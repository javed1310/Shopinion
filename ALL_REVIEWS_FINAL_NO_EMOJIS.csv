Premium product
"It’s my first iPhone ever and I bought it with my earned money through part time jobs in collegeI am a tech freak so you can trust my views -- A14 Bionic is the fastest, most efficient and reliable processor till date- The camera focuses so quickly that you can take DSLR quality photos.- The screen size 6.1 inches is the most comfortable screen size out there and the OLED retina XDR display is so crisp and everything feels real.- The stereo speakers are so clear even on high volume an...READ MORE"
Very good Smartphone . Best performance and battery beck up is still impressive with low MAH. Sharp camera. Camera is wow. Without camera setting and knowledge you don’t take batter Photo. I Uploaded camera picture in day and night time at same location.
This was an awesome buy. I bought this phone for my father who was upgrading from an iPhone 6. He is very happy with this phone. The size is really good. He said that it was even more comfortable to hold than the 6 as it had flat sides. It is Smaller than most android phones but big enough for anything and everything.The performance is Stellar. You won't notice any lag and it's very fast. Ram management is good too. And the phone stays at a reasonable temperature even when using Gmaps.Th...READ MORE
Very cool colour I loved it.
"It is my first iphone bought in bbd sale. Acc to me it is most value for money compare to others phone, everything is good display,sound,performance,everything except battery which is average acc to me. I charged my iphone 12 with 20W charger when my battery comes down to 40% and remove it from charging when it reaches to 80%. It takes about 30 min to charge it. My battery heath is still 100% acc to me which is goodHere are some samples taken by me in iphone12"
Camera is goodBattery is goodPerformance is also good
This was my second iphone after the xr and i can say there’s a lot of difference in day to day tasks.First of all here are some pros• Amazing camera with very good nightmode.• Performance is top notch.• No heating issue like other phones while performing daily   tasks.• The design is very handy and gives a premium feel in hand.Now the cons• Battery is sufficient but could be better but it’s ok for a medium user.• only one con bro that’s iphone there’s no complaint .
Best smartphone under 60k
"This is my 1st Apple product and I must say it's a beast of a device It handle everything in a very smooth ways, it's buttery smooth I'm just loving this device and I must say iphones have something unique in them which everyone must try outI will write my detailed review after using it for 2 months."

I think it’s price high according to its features bt display quality is too much awsm
"Nothing to say about this device. Absolutely flawless. Premium in-hand feel. Nothing to say about the camera. Surround sound works absolutely fine. A14 Bionic is just flawless. Smooth multi tasking. This is my first big upgrade to any flagship device and the usage is mesmerizing. Im literally impressed. Used 5s and 6s years ago, but nothing comes infront of this! Can blindly go for this device. Kudos to Flipkart and their next day delivery policy. Open box policy is also impressive. Go for it."

"iPhone 6S Plus 64GB -> iPhone 12 128GBMy 2nd iPhone, upgraded after 5 years.Gorgeous display, stunning new blue colour, excellent camera, best hardware-software combination, that’s how I would describe iPhone 12 as a package. Even though my previous iPhone had a 5.5” display and this one has 6.1” display, its overall body size is much smaller. Had to get used to it initially Opening/closing/loading of apps is fast. No issues there. Video playback on this screen looks gorgeous. Took...READ MORE"

"Switched from Android to iPhone and this transition was really smooth due to its easier GUI. I bought this 128 Gb variant and Didn’t waited for iPhone 13 as iPhone 12 has all ,what one need in a perfect phone. In person white colour seems much sexier than purple and black.

"An absolute charm to have this phone in your hands. Flipkart delivered in the next day in the BBD sale. Camera, display, looks, performance, smooth interface is all that makes iphones standout from rest. And iphone 12 delivers all that you require. Though iPhone's battery has always been the downside. Apple if you are listening we need much more larger battery capacity and you wont have to face any competition.And thankfull we didn't get Nirma soap in our box"

"Can finally tell I made the perfect colour choice for my first iPhone;Decent looking,Good interface as it's meant to be,very less visible fingerprints and surprisingly handy."
"Finally moved from Android (OnePlus 7T) to iOS & it’s a different level. Display is outstanding. Camera superb as usual. But surprised with the battery performance, its really great. Only drawback is the missing of 90Hz display, missed the fluidity of that. May be with time will habituated with that. But it’s worth noting. Overall an awesome luxurious experience from a luxurious brand."
"After being a long time samsung user i switched to iphone again after iphone 4s and i am thoroughly enjoying it. Ios 14 is much polished and android users will surely enjoy using ios now. Battry lasts a day with moderate use. Performance, usability, camera, sound and display everything is top notch. Icing on the cake apple car play is much more usable than android auto"
I like it exlent I phone 12

Best camera phone
So far so good. It’s my dream to own an iPhone for over a decade. Finally came true with iPhone 12. Previously owned Samsung S9 plus so competing with android i will say my likes and dislikes.Likes:1. OS is really fluid2. Security features like facial recognition for app installation etc3. Little nuances like ringtone sound reduction automatically after I see the mobile4. Camera is good though still equal to Samsung can’t say extraordinary5. Facial unlock is really quick6. 5G ready s...READ MORE
"This iPhone 12 was replacing Android , so it was always going to be a huge step up in performance, and this has not disappointed at all.  The new A14 chip makes light work of alternating between apps, camera and other functions of the phone, everything is so quick and the display is crisp and bright.The camera quality is outstanding, as a keen photographer, it is difficult now to decipher what has been taken with a dedicated camera (in my case a Panasonic LUMIX) or with the iPhone itself....READ MORE"
The phone is very smooth it for a processor is very nice It cameras are decent like DSLR the best phone ever first Apple phone
Worth of buying this product. It’s really a good stuff for apple lover.
An amazing color
"Overall a good experience. Takes sometime to get used to iOS if you're coming from android. The display is good, looks natural. I turned off true tone as I felt it made the display warmer than I like. Also you might find the colours not very saturated if you're coming from a Samsung phone.Battery is very good, lasts an entire day and more for me. Camera is also pretty good."
Got a genuine product. Checked the serial number online as well and it all matched. Works like a charm. Fast as ever. Worth the money
I was upgraded from iPhone X and it was great experience with all the latest specs and flawlessly smooth. Thanks to all new A14 Bionic chip.Build quality was great as always from Apple.Phone feels light on hands due to aluminium body. I chose Blue colour because wanted to go for different colour than routine Black and white iPhones so initially I was bit skeptical but after seeing the phone in person I’m happy with the blue colour “ not bad at all and not too flashy”Grip and feel perfect. ...READ MORE
"Now it's around 16 days using iphone 12, and the real things i like about this phone is camera and it's functions, fast charging processor and in hand feel.The product is worth the price. It's a brand that give you the worth of your money."
Super love you I phone 12
Nice
Very good product. Received in perfect condition from flipkart. I would recommend buying from flipkart at a great deal.
"Premium look..just go .without any doubt.superb camera ,red color is look too cool."
Stunning Phone from IPhone at Stunning price.1. Good Display.2. Good Looking Ceramic coated iPhone 12.3. Performance rocket.4. Camera awesome with added apps for photo n video. Seamlessly great
I was scared to buy iphone online after hearing horrific stories online. That apple care won't be included and all. But as soon as i started setting up and put the serial number online - got full apple coverage details. Before  creating an apple id the serial number would not show any coverage- so no need to panic just create apple id. Seller to flipkart and seller.
Nice

But the things had changed now. This new iPhone 12 should be bought with all the MagSafe accessories if you want to enjoy this technology beast. Be it camera, performance, multi tasking or whatever a smartphone can do, this thing does it better. Go for it."
Best deviceBest cameraBest performance(Small advice : go for 128gb)
"First time in my life I'm trying iphone, I'm an android Samsung note user. There are no powerful android phones which are compact to use single handedly..that's the main reason I'm living the iPhone. I didn't go for the 12 Pro max as it is ginormous in size and the 12 mini was reviewed to have sub par battery life. 12 and 12 Pro are the ideal phones for the best of both worlds. I didnt need the telephoto and Lidar camera, so I went with 12 to save some thousands. I'm enjoying the single hande...READ MORE"
"Mobile in hand fill is good like a premium,Camera not so it's just good,Battery backup is very good,Performance is very good."
no need to tell anything . Every one knows about I phone.
Got an iphone 12 128gb green colour as I expected thanks for flipcart. And when it comes to phone iphone is good and i love purple colour but i got green but it's ok when it comes to its performance and camera excellent and battery backup and charging speed is also good..
"price range is not for everyone but if you can afford it don't hesitate a bit because this phones gives you most realistic camera, stunning filters, efficient battery life, multimedia files take low storage, applications run smoothly and last but best part is the security features for messaging and payments.I am not asking everyone to buy it but if you can afford an apple phone then you should always go for it without giving a second thought"
"Best phone ever ..it cost me 54k ,no doubt best performance  ."
"Awesome.. this is my first switch to an IOS Device after using an adroid device untill now. And i am happy. The built quality, display, performance and responsive touch are just excellent.The camera is just way too good. Especially the night mode impressed me a lot. The phone is simple Amazing."
Updated myself from Iphone XR
"amazing, camara results is too good"
Love it Thynkew FlipKart for giving originality n genuine
Awesome camera and built quality
Appreciated with product!!!!!! It's amazing when I ordered there was so many doubt related products quality and refurbished Or duplicate... But when it was reached its amazing experience. Phone was fully packed as it bought from showroom...... And same with warranty... Warranty is in accurately activated by system... Very good product
It's just awsmmmm
Camera is awesome. Even the Night camera
Retina is not good than samsung galaxy s21 ultra
Iphone 12 it’s light weight. Handy and Comfortable.Blue colour looks sexy.Battery performance is great.Look is A1.
"Moved to iPhone from Android since cupcake days and I’m loving it so far. Brilliant display, camera and performance. IOS is still a little behind Android in terms of features and shortcuts in my opinion but it’s very close. Still getting used to all the features of iOS. Per-ordered on the launch day and it arrived barely on time. Overall happy with the purchase."
Good product
"While charging the phone, it is overheated and unable touch it. It is so hot while using also"

I like it

Iphone 12 better than 12pro
"As a android user new to Iphone how i felt in daily usage?1. Camera super2.

i am using this iphone12(black) since feb 1.  i am so happy. iam enjoying so much with this. i loved ur service. no fake delivery i got brand new iphone. the function of this phone is super. the only one thing which make me feel little bit sad is its potrait camera becoz of lacked telephoto lens. we cannot take zoomed potrait photos. in my view 2x zoom sholud be given in potrait mode according its price.AT LAST I WANT TO SAY THNKS TO FLIPKART AND ITS TEAM FOR UR FAITHFUL DELIVERY.

Superb phone!
"This phone is just awesome, i was planning to buy iphone 12 pro but 35k more just for single lens nahh! but this phone is great, camera, battery, screen ,handy and wow."

First time Switching completely android to iPhoneAmazing experience
Phone is goood. The clicks are awesome
"Not sure if FLIPKART would dare to keep this review.But if it clicks,then good.I won't review about iPhone12,because its my waste of time. We all are smart enough to watch videos rather than reading reviews here for iPhone.Review (For your safety):Make sure you keep all proofs especially video, while opening the box and initial check like dents,scratches etc etc within hour of delivery.Why its required?If you share photo or make delay in informing,you will realise that no one in the wo...READ MORE"
It’s just awesome...loved it
My first ios device. Oh boy this is a great device. I am so glad that I made the switch. The only thing I miss is the fast refresh rate of android but it’s not as bad as it sounds due to fluidity of iosCameras are excellent but not as sharp as newer android phones with bigger megapixels. But the quality and color accuracy of pictures are great.Battery life is also good. It would run a day and charges upto 90 percent in an hour.The display is gorgeous. One of the best.
Nice cell phone nice camera
Writing this review after 50 days of ‘heavy’ use.• The performance is just flawless. I played BGMI usually 6-7 hrs daily for 25-30 days (both classics and tournaments) with screen recording and never got even a single framedrop.• Battery performance is also good. While playing heavy games continuously it gives a backup of around 4hrs and around 3-1/2 hrs with screen recording. If u are not playing heavy games then the battery will last all day long and there will be still left around 20%...READ MORE
"First thing is I need to thank the seller for giving the original iPhone 12 for such a great pice. Once I got the product first thing I did was to check the serial number in the apple website and confirm the originality of the product.

It's maintaining apple's quality as usual. Good phone and compatibility use. The phone is little bit small when compared to other competitive products. There is no outstanding features in this phone when compare to Samsung or one plus. But I'm sure Apple uses must love this phone. The seller is also very good and they keep promising to deliver things on time for meeting Beyond expectations.
"I am fully satisfied with iPhone 12 …..And display, battery and software is absolutely amazing"
very good and nice i liked this i phone 12 my hand is Comfortable
Just Go for it
"Pros:- Same screen quality compared to 12 Pro. Features are also mostly similar except for a few (for example, three back cameras instead of two), which is not a matter of concern for me.- Consistent and super-smooth user experience of iOS. (If you are looking for feature richness, better to go with Android)- Predictable battery life. This means, if your phone is on standby with 2% battery left, you will see the almost same battery percentage even after 2 hours.- Square-shaped design co...READ MORE"

"Loved itMy first iPhone,  great camera, good battery and no heating issue. A must buy product."

Absolutely kudos to flipkart for delivering a classy product in a classy way the delivery boy refused to do open box even when it was a open box product but that filled up as soon as I opened the boxUsing it  now switched from android first I phone and can’t be better than thisValue for money thanks apple and flipkart
It’s been 1 month now and I’m just loving this phone every moments. Switched from android to iPhone for first time and had little challenge initially later loving it.
Camera performance is very good.battery back up around 7 hrs screen on time.performance very faster than ever.i love it
Best in segment earlier using s20 plus it has terrible heating issues. In big billions days i purchase this beast. 1st time iOS user camera is outstanding. After 3 hours gaming warm slightly . No lags .better battery backup then than any android flagship.
Very good. Photos are clear when there was light around.

The iPhone 12 is pretty familiar with iPhone 13 in terms of performance. So it’s worth buying iPhone 12 for this price point in 2021 than 13. It’s so much Value for money deal too.

Killer performance.love the way it is.Shifting to IOS after 11 years.
Phone is super okay. I gifted this to my girlfriend 5 months back. Now she cheated on me. I am paying EMIs. Otherwise no complain about phone.
Outstanding camera
Excellent camera
"OGIt’s been 20 days now that I have purchased the phone and I am having an amazing experience specially after using an android earlier.iPhone is just awesome. Don’t waste a chance you use an iPhone once in your lifetime.Pros- super fast, fast charging, music quality and camera quality are exceptionalCons- I can’t think of any such.Security is top level. If you are a trader or investor, go ahead with iPhone and experience the secured network"
Thank You so much Flipkart for the awesome deal. The smoothest OS I’ve ever seen. Buttery smooth.

"If you are first time ios user u are surely going to miss few things frm android but the sense of security u get frm ios is unquestionable , and about the device its upto the mark the screen is so fluid that u will love it and battery optimisation is also top notch all the games i hv tried run buttery smooth so if u are ready to compromise on some features u can definitely go for it"
"Upgraded from iPhone X.Noticed 3 major differences instantly.1. Lot of difference in camera pictures. The best camera model from iPhone so far2. Light weight and feels very handy during one hand use3. Screen brightness is better than iPhone XNot mentioning about other aspects like performance , speed as they already are close to perfect.Battery - not more than one complete day after constant usage of WhatsApp, safari, emails, spotify music & youtube videos"
I have purchased it in green color. It's actually very stylish and trendy. Initially I was doubtful about the color. But now I just love it.After ordering the very next day I received it. So the delivery was super quick.Camera quality is very good.I love it in this price.
"Nice camera nice design ios is extremely fast as expected.Cons:  if you are switching from android 5000mah battery and fast charger like 65w then you are going to face a big problem with battery backup , as apple support 20w fast charger so make a note of it ."
I always bought a android flagship device but i was very dissapointed because they all lag or record low fps video in third party apps that's is why switched to IOS now i m happy with the performance and also it's not bulky because it's a 6.1 inch display phone which is very easy to carryBig thumbs up for that
camera is very nice and performance is no word nice. I m very happy iphone 12. i buying 38000 only . white colour is very good.
Amazing:)
"As switched from an android to ios  it's worth upgrading .However ,there are some things particularly in iOS which i dislike for instance,it's a big challenge to transfer your data to a laptop unless it's a MacBook. Overall i can say the camera quality is top notch and processor which we all know it's the fastest chip yet furthermore the security we get is far better than android devices moreover thanks to flipkart for delivering the product earlier than the scheduled date."
"Always prefer Only Product RED, the amount what i paid will donate to HIV/COVID Fund"
Thank u so much such as a lovely phone.The battery backup is very good as compared  to other phone battery same mah.Camera is best.Phone running very smooth.
"This is my first iPhone after being an android guy for last 10yr. Main reason for the switch was, having an Macbook and airpod already. So wanted to experience synergy between apple products in its ecosystem. Here is my 2 week reviewPros1. Screen Quality is great. My last phone was Oneplus 7, so jump in screen quality was noticeable2. Performance. This phone with iOS feels extremely fluid. The old phone feels not so snappy compared to it. Also, since i have never used a 90Hz display so di...READ MORE"
This is my first Apple product and obviously I was very excited before unboxing it. The phone feels very premium and truly goes with the brand. Each and every specification of the phone is worth the money. So just go ahead and purchase it without any second thought. I pre-ordered it and received the product on time. Thanks Flipkart for prompt service.
iPhone is all time the best smartphone phone
"It Worth all the praises it gets, great phone with very good camera, night mode is excellent and battery good enough that can last a day."
"I got this 128 GB iphone 12 under 30 hours after order in big billion days 2nd October, thanks for fast delivery. At the price it's awesome, But when I charge it, battery is heating like I am cooking it in stove till 80%, after 80% it's getting normal. Face lock is very good but it didn't work with mask otherwise the phone siper good"

One of the best phone ever100% for battary100% for performance100% for cameraOverall perfect package
My first iPhone I am so happy
Awesome phone. Display is awesome fully true colour true value for money. Choose iphone 12 over 13..
"Finally got the most awaited iPhone 12 with favourite white. With this purchase I have now a complete Apple products family range includes MacBook IPad and now iPhone 12. Very easy to initiate after denoting the iPhone as I had migrated all the data quickly with signing in.Well it was a great deal with Flipkart, off course I got the the phone in two days after placing an order.It’s been a few weeks now using iPhone, it’s different experience altogether.Thank you Flipkart n Ekart logistics."
I am satisfied and happy
It's an apple so don't need to review. Always worth the money.
Loved it
Nice
Great service by Flipkart. Iphone 12 is just awesome. The only con is they must provide charger. The battery is not that much great but works for a day if sufficiently charged.
"Its like dream come true for me, Moved from oneplus6 to iphone 12 and loved it. Camera quality is world class and pictures are out of the world. Little low star in battery still at the end of the day you have to charge every other phone. Go for it."
"Over a Decade long android user switching to the iPhone for the first time.For the longest time i was an android fanboy, on account of being a power user who always wanted to customise things as per my requirement.I’ve come from using different Sony devices to 3 different OnePlus devices to the Apple iPhone.I weighed the pros and cons as one would with all the fairness one can impart while making a personal choice of buying a smartphone.

Apple is known for its true to life colours when it comes to the camera and you will not be disappointed with this one.

I first time use iPhone very nice mobile
Great phone but always purchase when you have discounted deals to get more value for money
This is my first phone gifted by my brother and it been approximately 6 months since i am using this iPhone 12and it’s very nice phone if you afford it thenBut one this it battery backup is not that goodOtherwise it is a fabulous phoneIf your pocket allow u than go for it
"I have been using iPhone 12 from past 10 days. Overall a great phone with best battery life, best camera and great display. The most important thing about this phone is the performance. It’s top notch. A14 Bionic chip which is 5mm SOC with 5G modem delivers a greater performance without any lag. With few latest iOS updates(14.7.1) and few changes in configuration/settings I get a battery life for 2 days per charge(96%). Overall a beast in all segments including the price."
I love you
Overall best product
Performance is top notch. Display is great. Camera is superb. User experience is first class. Battery also great.
It’s amazing believe me this is my dream phone. I hope you will enjoy this phone
Camera quality
Very nice phone..
"I bought this iPhone after plenty of research and it’s The best value for money iPhone with all mandatory features like IP68 rating , OLED Display , 5G with all 12 bands , 5 nm Architecture A14 Bionic Chip , Dark Mode with Dolby Vision , Wi-Fi 6 & NFC , Stereo Speakers , MagSafe compatibility . So  turning out to be a complete iPhone experience , truly loving it."

I don’t care what other thinks about this product but believe me the smoothness I feel while holding this in my hand is just amazing.

"Got this during the big billion sale. In 2021, at this discounted price, this is the most logical iPhone. There are millions of blogs and tech videos for the reviews. So, if you are planning buying one, you already know how it is."
Worth it guys white color is so premium
Android user for long time. Changed to ios because of good offer. Got 128gb for 51k during sales.
"Best value for money, if you wish to continue using same device for 3-4 years. Never hangs, awesome battery backup, Its processor is so powerful that it can run the app from same point of time where you left it 3 - 4 days back"
Added a camera protector and case. :)
Best memory
"I got the 128 GB variant in exchange at 42 k, the lowest I ever imagined on Flipkart. Comparatively with Android, since I was a hardcore Android user, these are my reviews after a week use:Pros:1.

Excellent product from Apple.. Just battery could have been better
I want to tell u something before I say anything about this iphone I'm not downgrading this iphone I just wasn't surprised enough after using the phone honestly it made me older.... Camera is the best no need to worry about that...the bionic A14 chip is fast no lags or anything screen is good too...ummm everything is fine but if u want to try something new don't go for iphone...that's my opinion...
Beat phone I ever usedPerformance is very goodBattery life is betterDisplay is smooth and vibrant
"Giving 4star just for the late delivery. Phone is good, will update the review after using few months."
Best mobile ever reasonable deal and zest money best
Phone is good.But heats up during gaming and charging.Night camera is awesome.Loved it.
Good performance
"The overall purchase experience of Apple products in Flipkart has always been great compared to other e-commerce platforms with tons of negative reviews. Received the package in perfect condition (one-day delivery), one will get the same feeling as expected from a retail store while purchasing. Did not find any red flags considering the price of the product where one tends to be more cautious with the condition of the product received."
Camera quality is good.Battery backup is not much better if you are heavy user or gamer but for normal use you will get 24hr backup easily.Performance is awesome but sometimes  at specific page it get freezes for a while but all other pages and app in background are running smoothly overall performance is best as comparison to android in this range.
"i shifted from samsung to apple i have s20fe and this one awesome camera,battery backup is also good there is no fast charging but still phone charges so fast ....ios is excellent"
Got iPhone 12 128 gb version for just 52k during October 2021 big billion sale.. This would be the cheapest price in 2021 to get this brand new iPhone in India..Performance of phone and its brilliant cameras are just mind blowing.. Really love this phone a-lot.. Battery backup could have been better.. but still it's manageable.. Thank you Flipkart for providing this phone for such a affordable price
"Satisfactory product but when you’re shifting from android to iPhone than you are facing some problems like as you can not use third party apps, no free app for music but when you’re using this product you’ll being comfortable with this."
"Top notch performance, get it if you have budget and want a reliable Smartphone for long term.Still apple need some improvement in display like high refresh rate, smaller notch or full screen display may be."
Very good product
Best camera quality
I’ve upgraded from iPhone 11 to iPhone 12. Camera is just awesome. A little better than 11. Audio quality is same. Battery is far better than 11.
Awesome iPhone. My first iPhone ever
Plz don't hesitate even a bit for ordering iphone from Flipkart.I still remember that when I decided to buy my first iPhone last year in November end I was very confused to whether buy it from offline store or online.As we know in offline store the prices are a bit high as compared to online sites. So my budget was actually exceeding in offline store and I was also not getting any discount or offer in offline store.So considering everything atlast I finally decided to buy iphone 12(64gb bl...READ MORE
I phone
Well
Got it for 51k 128Gb in BBD. thats a hell of a deal I got. performance is great. Battery is also Good as people’s says iphone don’t have good battery but I didn’t feel it. switch directly from mi a1 to 12. that’s why I can feel the performance. Overall it’s a good phone.
Just awsome and original product
My final review after using it for whole one week. Awesome Was a Hard Androider but as I switched really loving iOS Know. Guys the product is geniune please those who are saying flipcart is fake and all. Belive me it's an trustworthy Family. I thanks My seller and the entire team of Flipcart Thank you so much. Regards.
"Worth the money invested. My first iPhone and it could not have been better than this. The look, the ease of use, the security and the display+camera it's just awesome."
Excellent phone... And flipkart delivered it perfectly the packaging was very nice and was properly sealed and product was 100% genuine...
This is my first iPhone and the initial impression is just awesome.I will post the detailed review after some months
Excellent
"Does iPhone even need a review? Its an amazing product and if you crave for awesomeness, ultra performance, cult and sheer solidarity then go ahead and buy. It has a steep price point but marvellous things do come at a premium. Plan, Save & Then Buy!"
"I upgraded from iPhone 7 Plus, So it a bigger and better screen with smaller form factor ratio. I miss touch id specially in pandemic time but face id solves the purpose most of the time. I bought 128GB variant and the difference from 64GB and 255GB is -10k and +10k which means apple is charging too much for 64GB storage, that means its not value for money exactly.. However buying a 64GB variant is a trap as you will need to keep on deleting data only."
product is amazing but the experience with flipkart is very bad. I had mentioned GST no of my company at the time of placing the order but there was no gst no mentioned in the invoice. numerous mails and complaints lodged but they refused to provide me GST invoice.
"Like a beast, all rounder"
"Good build quality, camera & speakers."
"Undoubtedly awesome in performance, after all it’s , didn’t like battary backup though, with heavy usage can’t survive for a day, need to juice up in evening, another disadvantage is No fast charging.. Camera is good but not best out there and also keep in mind there is no file manager for data management and data sharing is not as easy as android."
Truly said 'its just not a phone.. it's an IPhone ... Very very nice. . super satisfiedIt's just apple should have given basic things like charger within the box
"Perfect iPhone . Glad that I Pick iPhone 12 instead of iPhone 11 , Prices are bit high but Features are completely fill that Price Gap . I love that Device . Happy User"
Best product you can trust Flipkart. delivered in two days
Just bought my first iPhone. Been using it for like 15 days now. This is littt.Was worried about battery performance before buying. But it far exceeded the expectations. Can last even 2 days if you use judiciously with low power mode.20W adaptor is sufficient.A decent power packed smartphone tailored to fit in all needs.
No doubt Look and Feel is premium which gives you different feeling when you put out it from your pocketCamera + Display + Battery which is very less in numbers but actual performance is far better than 108MP camera + 7inch Display + 7000mah batteryPricing as usual is very high even if it is purchased in sale moreover they don’t even provide charger earphones back cover tempered glass even booklet is of single page
I was using realme x7 max before purchasing iPhone 12 but honestly I want to tell one thing that iPhones are overhyped and nothingI don’t feel any upgradation from my previous phone but compromised from many aspects.So please don’t waste your money for a false status and choose an good android phone and invest your rest money for your better future.
"Reviewing this after 3 months of use...You can't find anything wrong with this new iPhone 12 , finest camera quality , sound quality, luxury feeling this is little atom bomb , got the best deal by Flipkart"

"What a amazing phone ! I bought this amazing beast for my soul mate & she’s very happy and blissful.Wonderful camera , beautiful design must buy worth every penny"
"Was using the OnePlus 7 pro before this, it was a 2 year old device but still had better battery backup than this Iphone. Rest you all know its an iphone, great camera, nice screen, ios is very smooth and consistent which many android phones lack, Face ID is a pain during Covid and boy they don't give charger which sucks.Overall a nice phone, battery should have been better"

"I bought this phone on August 2024. It is an excellent product. Top quality and top performance. Works perfectly well in 2024. No much difference with the 13, 14 or 15, unless you want to have more features in your camera. Otherwise the regular user will never mention any difference in speed and performance between compared with A14 and A15 unless you play very heavy games. I am happy with the product and I also wish to thank Flipkart for prompt delivery."
"My first iPhone, the best experience,out of 64 gb around 50 gb we get to use which is enough for me."
Good performance
Awesome
Battery last for less than a day when used much but very ultra fast chargingOverall nice product.  Donot break screen easily as like other mobiles. Strong.  I like in this concern.
Amazing phone 2023
Camera is Awesome
"Thank God my oppo reno 8 pro couldn't be delivered and I had to order Iphone 12. IOS is buttery smooth, camera is excellent, video stabilization is too good, 100% lag free performance, battery last for 1 day with moderate to bit heavy usage but it doesn't fit for gaming, I would recommend to go for iphone 14 if budget is tight so wait for upcoming sales. This is my first flagship and first iphone and I am very impressed with everything that flagship android can't provide at this price point. ...READ MORE"
One of the best phone from the best brand
Superb built quality.Awesome camera quality.Great performance.
Mobile is good.but the issue it was not charged at the receiving time.. So I was worried so much bcz this is my 1st iphone. So I don't like this thing atleast it should 5%charged.and the issue is battery it really discharge too much fast and it has heating issue same as Android.। Choose this phone bcz Android has a heating issue and thought that iphone has not the same problem but it also has a heating issue that why I don't like.।But the camera quality is awesome I like only camera quality
Enjoying my first ever iphone
One of the best camera ever
Very good camera.

"It was a fantastic purchase. Based on initial review, the product is delivered before time, exchange process was smooth less.The service by flipkart was amazing, as received a call regarding my purchase and if I have any complains.Phone: Functioning well, camera is efficient and above market standard.

Highly satisfied with the delivered product Apple has done an amazing job with each n every department of the phone it’s a marvellous experience till now
"Loving the experience,absolutely fantastic.Pros: Great Camera, The screen is spectacular, people are comparing the screen with iPhone 13 , but in practical use iPhone 13 just little brighter on full brightness, rest no diff. Size is just perfect and feel is top notch premium . Night shots are fantasticCons: though the battery is good and lasts about a day with reg use, it could be better, but no complaints"

"So, I upgraded to iPhone 12 after using iPhone 7 Plus for 5 years which was also running decently but I thought it’s time to upgrade now and yes, you will definitely feel a big upgrade one you switch. Apps are snappy, camera is superb, low light photography is amazing thanks to the OIS.I think for the first time I am noticing improvement in battery backup.I would highly suggest going for an AppleCare+ plan once you purchase.

Apple IPhone 12Excellent performance in all areasiPhone “Everything is their with there limits”
Awesome Phone . Shifting From Android To ios Too Difficult But It’s just matter of time.
This is the best phone ever in my life
Big billion days and deepawali sale make it possible for millions of indians to purchase this Iphone without harming any internal organs or bankruptcy. Iphones in india are only value for money during big billion days.
Best in performance and value of money felling rich always with iphone brand
"iPhone 12 is a great choiceproms-1. Camera2. Smoothness as always in all iPhones3 looksCons:1 . Battery is not at all good, I hardly use phone but battery within 12 hours. iPhone must improve its battery"
"Great camera, great displayOnly battery backup is less and heating issues."
I have bought iPhone as i have been gifted with airpods and now apple watch. So taking about the pros are it has superb screen and camera is way to awesome. I feel UI is better than andriod phone and Siri helps a lot. Cons would be battery backup is not good as compared to andriod phones. Also I bought it for 67999 which is indeed a good amount. Also it only has one sim so you cant use two sim like android. So its upto you to decide which suits you more and buy accordingly.
Battery is typically like a 4000mah device uses with two sims. ( assuming u use iphone 12 with one sim with location wifi etc off). For office type use its no issue. Field work types people will want more battery for sure. Cameras are good. Apps aren’t bulletproof as they claim. Ola app has bugs. Doesn’t hang. But its still not as fast fluid as one plus. Its not slow mind it. But the buttery transitions on ios make it relatively slow. Speakers have bass sorta.
Decent Device at decent price.!Disclaimer: I’ve received this for Rs. 49400/-Performance: Up to the mark.Display : ABattery: You have to charge everyday if you are a moderate user . Also it has a great standby time as compared to its android competitors.Camera: It takes good photos but I do miss Gcam.Android or IOS: well android gives lot of freedom to customise your device and download apps that are restricted in play store and this is not the case in IOS .Though Apps  run better on IO...READ MORE

Best iPhone ever. Display is awesome and it is working super fast. Bought it in big billion days for Rs.49000.It is worth the money
Good one for video shoot not gaming
beautiful product
Awesome.
Providing review after 1 month of use .. no doubt it’s a good mobile handling is very smooth n performance is very good as well front camera is descent back camera is awesome with a nice detailing… cons battery life is not very long proper use of phone may need charging once in every 10 hours … if you lay down and try to open the phone by face recognition then it doesn’t work .. you need to hold the phone flat parallel to your bed then it opens up.
I loved it! Also loved the color! I hoped a better camera though…
Awesome phone but late delivery...!
Everything was good except delivery .Now coming to phoneI was an hardcore android user and using iphone for the first time so it is very difficult for me to use to of iphone because this is my first IphoneOverall device is good for nowWill update my review after using some time.
Excellent colour and quality.

You can’t get a product like this on android. Except for the price everything is excellent!
"Very handy specially designed, camera, screen I m very impressed for iphone 12 bcz it's my first iOS mobile. Amazing lovely design elements looking premium and camera quality is owsm. There is no error occurre no fault evert thing looks perfect. Just go for it (iphone 12 64gb) price is 45k bcz 4k off with SBI Bank offer and  5k off for exchange my old mobile phone. At this price range must go for it."
"No need to mention about the quality of the Apple products. I brought green colour iPhone 12, which is an excellent colour. I am attaching the Snaps taken from my iPhone 6s Plus. Got this item from Flipkart at good discounted price. Flipkart delivery is expected, but expected to be delivered in a day. Got this item in two days as per the plan."
Loving the phone. It gives premium experience with all the apps and devices connected to itThanks to Flipkart to delivering it so quickly.

"Pros : Performance beast, great camera, top notch security, regular updates and undisputed in terms of brand value…Cons : limited customisation options, gets kinda boring after a while as you can’t do much on open platforms which may lead to security breach for your data."
"This is my second iphone after 13 pro max for my sister.The quality of 12 series is all most same as the 13 series with less cost.If you are looking for an android device with this budget you will disappointed for sure.The camera,display,OS and premium feel is not comparable with any 50-60k budget android devices and the performance is far better than any.But i give you some advice those who like to purchase iphone 11 and XR please do avoid to purchase and go for iphone 12,its a big leap f...READ MORE"

Front Camera at low light doesn't give a good result at all. Looks Cheapest Camera ever.But in light it does work good and about other things its just Apple.A Perfect Masterpiece.Very light Weight device with Quality Look.
Camera pe perfect.Screen is good but smaller then the other smart phone which are half on price.Price was good on big billion day but not on diwali sale.Don’t understand the point of buying the charger saprately.

Authentic Product from flipkart… Missed the sale value but got it with a good discount after 2-3 days of sale… Loved the phone but yes the battery is not much good and a earbud is required if you are planning to buy this phone as you will be irritated by talking in headset or in speakers
Delivery was on time with no much hustles. Happy with iPhone12! Thank you.

It's very nice and if you bought it during sale then all the more better..total value for money

It is great experience feel something different in experience from usual android I was used till date. I just brought for just wanna try other operating system. Pinch of salt feels yummy. Actually it is overall great phone with beast performance with great build build quality.
My iPhone is only 3 days old and it's doing excellent till now..
"A Beast in terms of performance, display and Camera. If you are willing to spend the said amount, just go for it without giving a second thought. The experience is amazing. Battery backup is okay, but rest of the things are top notch."
Do you really need a review of this Premium product?One word........    MASTER PIECE
My 2nd iphone Is Iphone 12 Great Experience And great price
Wowww amazing product
Nice product.Battery is decent.Camera is very nice.And genuine product.
Battery not standing for long time
"Purchased the 128Gb version to be future proof with respect to storage. Thankfully HDFC credit card offered a 6k instant discount that enabled me to buy 128Gb version for price of 64Gb! Major reasons to buy the phone are its design, oLed screen (unlike LCD in iPhone 11) and Qualcomm x55 modem for better call and data."
not satisfied with flipkart response team .. otherwise phone is marvelous.. no need to define ... its Apple
Classic
Loving It
Best phone
My second iPhone after XR get stolen overall good purchase look and weight is perfect
Phone is great but price should be some less.
"A beast totally a beast, This is why A iPhone is different"
Ultra fast speed with a perfect camera and ultimate battery.Full paisa wasool..
Good
"Finally a complete phone by AppleThis phone will do everything you need your phone to do and more. The screen, the camera, speakers, battery, build quality, in hand feel, all are consistently good.It's a no non sense phone which is also future proof, thanks to the A14 chipset and 5g support.I wouldn't say its cheap, but apple is infamous for that.If you can afford it, it'll not let you down."
"Fees like iPhone 5 has grown up to be an adult. 8 years of iPhone 5, this phone is a beast. Amazing build quality, OLED display makes it a charm. The camera quality is also super. Highly recommend."
"An apple fan, I find iPhone 12 light, easier to use than iPhone 11 as is compact in size and weight, display is a little better than iPhone 11, speed is also better and satisfactory. To my disappointment; there was no charger and no earphones in the box. Also the price strategy of apple for its products in india is positioned much higher than the developed countries while it should have been the other way round as the capacity to pay of people of developing nations like india is much lower th...READ MORE"
Its my 2nd iPhone
fully satisfied with apple
If you can increase your budgetThen please purchase Iphone 13/14Because the battery is so less in upto This Iphone ModelsOverall the product is awesome
Nice but battry performance was very bad but nice in this range. Picture quality is good from back camera. Front camera not good.
"When I was buying a new iPhone, I was very confused about where to buy online or offline and also which online platform is better.But my friend suggest me flipkart is very Trustable plateform.What is good in this phone  !1. The camera system is one of the best in any smartphone. I love the Night mode feature, which allows me to take great photos even in low light conditions.And many more things"
Very nice
Good product
"Overall it's good, but camera isn't that great compared to pro version of iPhone and latest OnePlus phone. Battery is definitely an issue, with low MaH power battery doesn't support full day. Takes two times charging if you have a regular usage with all your office and personal work on one phone"
Nice product but next time I will go with android phone
Superb
Everything was good except for battery . So i switched to i phone 13 cos it has better battery life
Fantastic camera lens
Excellent camera
Good
"A beautiful looking phone with Mediocre battery(based on usage), average display(coming from an OP phone) and an excellent camera. This phone is worth the money if you need a phone which can be an all rounder and you don’t change your phone every year. Mine was a simple decision for an all rounder phone with exceptional camera and Smooth OS."
I bought it for 54k. Nice packing and delivery. But phone becomes very hot while charging /inside a car/playing games. I used proper adapter for charging as well.
Phone is good at this price range
Loved its wide angle
Camera good
I love the way this phone takes pictures and videos. IOS is unmatching with existing phones in market due to its software and hardware combo. Camera is best. Overall nice phone after using iphone 7. Its way more better than iphone 7 comparing to camera. This is my second apple phone. We need to buy charger separately. This phones backpanel is too stylish. Phone is light weight compared to 7
Front and back cameras not so good compare to other products in this rate and betray life not up to the mark other then these as usual I phone is good
"Excellent phone…its an apple phone so no need to discuss about the performance…battery is also great, camera is excellent and video is industry best. Only 2 cons are some apps are not working properly and 60hz display at this price point"
"It is my first iphone.. Purple colour is just eye attractive colour.. After using 1 week writing this review.. Camera quality, display awesome.. But battery backup is not good.. Overall the phone is woww..."
If you need IOS then go for it
"Pros:Camera, display, sound, performance, smoothness, design, face unlock, charging is fine.Cons:Personal hotspot doesn’t work sometimes, lot of apps have bugs in IOS version, Siri doesn’t respond properly few times.Overall it is best phone currently."
Expect heating issue n gets hang some times maybe a software glitch or something except that apple is good brand as all always
"Everything is superb and the most I liked in this phone is its Design and Camera and coming on battery life, it is also perfect for me lasted for more than one day as I mostly use my phone for surfing and sometimes for watching video. Really  it."
Best camera experience and display value for money product
FIRST TIME I MOVE TO ios ..... to be frank first two days my mind came with thought that why i waste my money on it.  but later on i loved it..... there is no compair of android to ios. compairing ios to android like you compairing Rolls Royce to Maruti SUzukei
Best phone everything is perfect
Loved the product.. only back camera quality is not upto the mark
Best Value for money phone under 40K
most trustable brand as well as its performance is damm beast

"Excellent service by flipkart, Best Colour"
Very nice until it dropped
Best ever experience with my new iphone 12
Camera :- is awesome 12MP Cam take’s Less storage and give us better quality pictures.Battery :- is also Good and also fast charging with 20w charger giving 1 day backup with heavy usage.Performance:- No one can beat Apple in this price segment buttery smooth experience.Ios:- well optimised os Giving us smooth experience.
Great mobile with great processing speed .I love it.
I am in love with it
It's my wife's dream phone. She is very delighted from my this perfect gift. Thanks flipkart.
"Of course, you'd have watched all the review videos etc.The only gripe could be the 60 Hz display but trust me you'll hardly notice it and it never gets in the way of the incredible experience Apple phones provide."
Value for money.
Worth bought in pre booking
"Worth it, upgraded from android one plus. Got it delivered early in just two days."
"What's The Fuzz About Iphone. It's A Decent Phone. But Even Poco, Redmi Give Similar Display And Performance At One Forth Price.Although, IOS Seems Better Than Android, But IOS Could Be Better"
"Been using it for a week now, its just awesome. i checked the authenticity through apple store, its genuine .the display, performance,the camera and the over all look of the phone is just amazing."
"Awesome product ,worth for money."
I upgraded it from my Redmi note 5 pro > iPhone 12
The phone is a true value for money product…and I’m writing this review after 1 week of use…there are some important things to be mentioned1. The premium feel is the most important thing one can deserve…this phone is the best one to have that feeling.2. The most satisfactory thing is the battery performance…you can use the phone whole day after having full charge in the morning. Battery draining is very less unless you’re doing some heavy work.3. Now talking about the camera experience…th...READ MORE
"Upgraded from Iphone X. If you are in Apple ecosystem, this is a good phone to upgrade. I'm glad I chose this phone 12 over 12 pro. The extra sensor and lens in pro is not worth the extra 35000 IMO. The delivery was perfect and right on time! Thanks Flipkart!"
Amazing
Flipkart supporting very bad
"It is really a nice product by apple but there are some disappointments too. First the battery is small, and that’s why the phone is very light (this is the advantage), If you are updating from iphone 6 or 7 you will not mind but if u are updating from phone 11 then you would definitely find a difference. Second thing the display is not that bright. I compared it with iPhone 11 and 7 plus and saw that 11 and 7 plus both were more bright. Third when we use the camera for like more than 5-10 mi...READ MORE"
"It’s powerful performance Good choice to buy, But display should be full Screen like Samsung Amoled..Go for it , Gd quality HD pictures u can click.."
Good phone that's all Purchase if u can afford big amountsRed colour is attractive Remember to buy Charger Head
It’s a very light phone I totally loved the performance of this phone Shifting from android to IOS has some initial challenges but now I am use to it its a perfect fit phone in handBattery is pretty good for normal use I you and not fond of watching Videos and play games it last for 1.5 days with some gaming and video its manage to last a day.Camera is super awesome in day light and performs pretty well on Night also.
"Battery Performance is Worst , Just Lasts For 7-8 hours after full charge on regular use ."
Mobile is great with good camera performance but facing battery issue after 1 year of use. Now I have to charge 2-3 times a day and having heating issue too.
"I have been using iphone 12 for almost 2 years and i found that its battery is very poor while compared to price. Only 3.5 hours battery backup~ screen on time and apart from this all good , except camera don't like it. day by day its selfie becoming uesless very bad (1/10) for selfie."
Been using it for an year and the battery life is terribly bad.
NOT AS EXPECTED! BIT DISAPPOINTED!
Awesome just go for it if you want an iphone under 30k on saleCamera is best in class but battery backup is not good as it only have 2800mah. For a phone with 2800mah battery it gives good backup. Hard to run 1day full
Best within the budget of 50k
"Much hyped... Good for a BBD purchase 51k, usable for a normal user..  Got it for my wife, she loved it.. Personally, Android flagship model user, love the SD 888 performance... Can vouch for the iOS, nothing superior if you have proper hardware..  hope apple support will be strong... Go for it if you love the brand gimik..."
This camera also osm
"i am giving one less rating as the phone which was provided to me was kept in storage for long and the sticker glue was starting to set on the mobile, plus the mobile was having some dust after unboxing it.Apart from that all the things seems to be okay and as expected applish"
I would suggest better go for pro that might be more useful in long run
"Well i returned back to iphone after ip7 because original is original and no one can replace the same.Whether in terms of usage or performance , features iphone excel in all of these.Phone Audio quality is best and no phone could match that pure natural sound , you will love itRest phone display is excellent OLED with 460PPI text and videos look amazing and built quality is very good.Now most important part that no other phone could match is its software.

"Once an Apple user always an Apple user!Started off with an iPad and the experience with it lead me to buy an iPhone ..... It’s on a different level ... luxurious phone from a luxurious brand .. Be it camera quality ,stereo speaker , full OLED display , night mode ,A14 bionic chip performance, very light weight and so on .... we can talk all day about this iPhone ... A perfect masterpiece !"
Nice camera

1. Battery drains very fast.2. Photo quality superb.3. Cannot migrate from android to ios. Move to ios app is not effective and good.4. Android is far better in handling.5. Power adapter was not provided.  Got it after 01 month from flipkart (separately purchased). Till now charging with my Samsung A50.6. Overall not satisfied at all.
Shoot in I phone12
"My first switch to the iOS ecosystem, been a wonderful with experience. Glad it was with Apple iPhone 12! Great product absolutely loved it."

He unboxed the package in video recording and we checked whether the product is correct and not having any dent.To Flipkart customer care 0 star, since they are dumb and will only reply copy paste message.To product, what to say it's an iPhone....Over all the product safely reached out, I would suggest to go with while or green color as they look awesome.For longer usage, as I generally do not change iphone I went for 128 gb...READ MORE"
Iphone 12 is  just love. I switched from iphone 7 to iphone 12 and this phone has hell lot of features. Looks are classy and elegant. Camera quality is amazing not doubt samsung s21ultra have better zoom camera than this but the feel you get while having a iphone and colors generated by its camera processor have no comparison. Little bit costly but when people praises its display and camera quality every penny spent on this feels justifiable.
Not bad but battery performance is low
I upgrade to 12 from iPhone X but was not satisfied spending hefty amount as nothing amazing is present apart from few new camera features
"Just like other phones, I can make and receive phone calls!"
Awesome
Super
Money worth
recommended
The most liked thing in this mobile is it's camera....Display size seems small for me ...... i hate notch.......I don't like design
"Got the 128 GB version at 56K. The experience is amazing. Last I used iPhone 6S and then switched to One plus, but the experience with iPhone is everlasting. Major upgrade is the fast charging and a lot of hidden features which u can get only on iPhone 12 and onward versions."
It's just amazing loved the deal and the iPhone
Excellent phoneLoved it
I have received same mobile as shown on picture.Thank you Flipkart
To much good
Amazing device. Fortunately i didn't receive a stone or a mango  . Thanks to flipkart's open before receiving service )

Definitely a first apple product which is value for money.Battery is good for day to day normal use, easily lasts upto a day.Charger is fast. I only charged for 30-40 mins and use for a day.Display is superb however it give yellowish look you can adjust it via color correction.Heating issues is very minimal only if you use camera for a very long time or in hot temperatures areas....READ MORE"

I made my cousin bought the same phone so that i am not the only idiot letting down our family .Just to let you know guys, this mobile has sane call quality which  a nokia 1100 (15 years old mobile) had.Now a days i hold my phone in a manner so that the apple logo is visible to everyone, even though i am speaking to my credit card collection team for non pay...READ MORE"

Its performance remains top-notch, even after all this time. The sleek design and vibrant display make using it a visual treat. Plus, the regular software updates have kept it feeling fresh.

"Just wow. Flipkart did a good job in delivery. Only thing is, even though I opted for open box delivery, I was told my order was not eligible by the delivery guy. The lack of customization and different levels of automation compared to android is the only negative thing on switching from Android to IOS. Still 5 Stars."

"When switching from android to iPhone, in starting we may feel many flexible things are missing but quality of iPhone overrides those all, Camera is incomparable. I liked battery backup n charging speed is good with 20W adapter(purchased separately), it would have been better if we can get it in box."

"Super cool phone. So fast and great battery. Though it’s iPhone, no need to say anything about it. It’s the best phone ever."
Impressed with camera.
Apple needs no review but I have to say where battery could have been better. Thank you Flipkart for genuine product
"Very great mobile to buy. Camera is awesome, no need to tell about the display. Battery is a little bit strong than 11."
Well there is not any specific reason to praise the purchase. But I’m happy about the price at which I purchased and it’s display is far far better than iPhone 11.
Super happy

Iphone 12 best phone
Super cute mobile
Best
The flipkart delivery was good and the delivery guy opened the pack in front of me as per the steps described. He also asked me to check all the checkpoints to identify if phone was in a good condition. Iphone 12 is amazing and had a good battery life. Lasts 1.5 day with normal use and 4g services shut down when not required. Has a amazing processing speed
Best design and look.
"Amazing mobile. Fabulous performance, extraordinary display, A14 Bionic chip overlay superb…"
The Best Phone. Only pros and no cons other than the price.
Best phone !!Writing review after 1 month’s use
Super secure phone.Best quality camera . A14 Bionic chip is better than snapdragon 850 processor.
Awesome
"BBD deal was amazing. I only upgraded my iphone to 12 bcoz of that crazy deal. Rest iphone 12 has no flaw, as smooth as previous models. Keep giving us such great deals."
Yes. Meet the expectations.

Awesome phone thank you Flipkart
"It’s mention-worthy for the unexplainable service of iPhone 12, really fortunate enough to own this at this affordable price offered by Flipkart. Looking forward to participate in the “Grand Sale” in coming days."
Thank you for delivering dream... It's awesome! :)
The best and worth every penny you spend on this device. If only they could have added a bigger mAH batter it would have been much better to use longer time.
This is after 6 month the product is too good
Camera quality awesome
Good product . Receive as expected.
Beast device at a great price!
Satisfactory
Upgraded from Iphone 5s to Iphone 12. Mind blowing looks and top notch performance. No criticisms.

"It's good phone , thanks Flipkart"
Amazing product. There is nothing like it.
Best phone in this price
"Great Product from Apple. Go for iphone 12 however if like to invest 40k more for one more camera, 180 nits brightness difference (which you cannot differentiate b/w both of them) and slight design difference then go for iphone 12 pro.Otherwise iphone 12 gives you all the features which an individual wants in a good phone."
Awesome
Reall awsm product
Awesome
Everything in iPhone 12 is good but not at all happy with camera . Very much not satisfied with The camera quality . If u zoom the pics taken on iPhone the pixels break . Really unhappy .Battery life and everything else is good enough.. I hope for camera we get some good update
I've switched to ios from oneplus and iPhone 12s camera is beyond my expectations I'm enjoying the experience of iPhone. and it was very quick delivery from Flipkart
Very handy and poweful device only facing some  heating  problem  overall nice
Fully satisfied with camera and performance
"Most important pros of this mobile is the ""Purple Colour"". Really the colour is amazing."
Good deal and genuine product I’m happy
"Awesome device, Butter Smooth, worth Every penny.This is my first apple device and i loved it! Awesome, and received it in just 2days Thankyou flipkart."
It was my first iPhone it was very good i loved it‍
Alhamdulillahmy first iPhoneThank you filpkart timely delivery
"An absolute steal at the price during big billion day! got 2 of 'em. A great phone to no one's surprise, especially the camera is awesome. Recording on this phone is better than any android phone I ever used."
One of my best buy on Flipkart as well as my first iPhone. Just loving it more & more. Big billion day sale was deal breaker for me...
Nothing to Say. It’s a power pack in n performance and alrounder in almost all aspects. Bought it in Big Billion Dussehra sale at 55k. Only thing is it heats when charged with 20w charger that too if sorrounding temperature is also higher. I think it’s usual.
My first iOS upgrade and it surprises me about its performance and features. Very happy by buying it.
Good performance
"Great phone. The performance is top notch, no lags in daily usage and UI is butter smooth. Camera is does a good justice too, the best part is it automatically adapts to lighting conditions and turns on night mode. Battery’s lasts for a day with normal usage."
Till date i was using android phone this was my first i phone finding it very easy to use than android less apps to really happy with the phone performance & Flipkart service too got the phone earlier than expected
Nice camera and niceperformance
Best
Bestest ever seen
VALUE FOR MONEY
"A complete package…after being an android user for 8yrs shifted to IOS with mind full of confusions but finally fully satisfied with the move…iphone12 is not only symbol of status but also packed with performance, great camera and fabulous software with high end security…"
"Loved it switching from android to ios was a pain but hardware and software experience is awesome, buttery smooth experience. Still software wise android rocks"
Osm camera
Superb display
Got in big billion day with grt price ....everything was superb
Device is awesome. Upgraded from iPhone X to 12. Extremely light phone. Feels good n looks superb. Bit late delivery from Flipkart but ok.
Super smooth display with best quality camera on offer and optimum battery life
After using around 10 days. iPhone 12 is awesome. Thanks flipkart giving opportunity to buy in the range of 55k for 128 GB. Loved it.
I am loving it
This my 4th Apple device. iOS experience is better than Android. I Use both Android & Apple. Still iOS performance is smooth & display is really great. Only downside I feel is about battery & Notch. Other than that it worth every penny.
Best in build quality and in-hand feel
"Just have it. Every penny you would be spending, worth it."
Thank you flipkart grabbed a great deal during Big Diwali Sale
Good
Nice mobileDisplay is very awesomeVery slimWeight less
Excellent camera ….very nice performance &battery is also good
Very nice and best price I love flipkart
I am using the apple phone for the very first time. I am very much excited and the performance of the phone is too amazing. Happy user
"This is my second iPhone and I just got in 52k,and also a good deal ,thanks to Flipkart"
Awesome product
Camera is superb. Battery is good. Display is brilliant. Getting used to IOS . Performance is awesome till date
I think there is difference in Assembled in Chain and Assembled in India.. I felt little touch issues with Indian variant in few apps. Other than that very good battery life and awesome camera.Also you won’t get adapter and ear pods
Camera—super in this timeBattery is very excellent
Super powerful phone best display loving it
Value for money my 1st iphone
Amazing product
Finally I got my I phone and I’m so happy it’s working very smoothly and high level experience thanks flipkart for the osm deal big billion day
Superb quality smartphone  love it ..
Value for money
WORTH EVERY PENNY…..Awesome battery life.Camera is top notch Display is goodAudio output also good .In case of performance it is a beast no comparison.BGMI runs super smooth.IOS experience is awsome super smooth.Buy 20W apple charger fast charging is superb This is my first iPhone and I just loved it Thanks Flipkart for deliver genuine product.
My first IPhone after using Android phones for around 12 years. Really don’t regret switching. Like how everything just works. So refined. Camera too is very consistent. You don’t need to take multiple shots to get a good one. Only problem I have faced till now is the poor performance of Truecaller on IOS. Hope apple changes this with future ios updates. Got 128gb variant for 50k during BBD. At that price this is a great VFM option.
"Absolute beast of a phone.Pros: excellent camera, nice gorgeous display, very lightweight.What could have been better: battery. Good but not as good as the android counterparts. Have to keep it at low power mode. Although just a week. Will update after a month’s usage."
Awesome phone. Great camera and amazing speed.
iPhone 12 best phone
Once you buy this phone you don’t need a new phone until 7 to 9 years. That is what support given by apple.
Just one word Aweasome..
Awesome love you great  deals
Its an iPhone. It’s enough to describe it.

I am the 1st time iPhone user. Compared to android. Using iPhone is bit complicated but we will get something new to explore. iPhone performance is more than my expectations.

Superb Camera is just awesome Display and sound quality far from expectations
"If we talk about iPhone, it is the price and the price i have got it for 48k is amazing for this device compared to iPhone 13 which is around 70k , if u r android user earlier, let me tell you it is iPhone and u can not judge it reading reviews u have to get it one and it is the best phone to get in 2021-2022 get one for yourself without thinking!!!!!!!"
"It’s absolutely beast in all aspect !!!!!No matter what u do it wont disappoint you at all…….moreover it gives you an amazinggg value if you compare with it’s successor ‘13’…There is absolutely nignlegible difference between both of them…..but the value the 12 provides is amazing!!!!!I loved its camera ,performance,display and thr colour green!

What a look  superb  dont think go with dis best
NYC product
Great product
Excellent display and camera
First time using iphone.... Amazing experiences so far...Really loving it...
"I will be honest that I was skeptical about ordering iPhone from Flipkart, but thankfully I did. The overall experience had been great. On-time delivery, multiple calls from support team to check on the product.Aa for the iPhone 12 itself, it’s a classy one, got a beastly upgrade from my iPhone XR. Good performance, camera, battery (for now); even though facing slight heating issues while charging the phone"
Upgraded me from iPhone XR. It feels like an upgrade for sure. It approx 30gm lighter and the overall experience is flawless.Anyways nothing more to say about Apple as a brand. :)
Amazing phone with good display and fabulous camera..Only concern is gap between rim and display because dust can be easily go there even if we use good case and it’s very difficult to clean..
This is my 5th since 2013. The Biggest enhancement is in the Display and speedy Smoothness.
black color is love
The phone is awesome but too highly priced because of the brand. Bought a phone first time on an online platform.I was very scared till I received the phone in my hand. The flipkart team was very helpful as they helped me with all my queries.
Overall good phone except battery
100 n 100% genuine product
Very good deal found from Flipkart thanks very happy with my new mobile phone thanks again.
Amazing Just Wow
Excellent looking and durable mobile
The phone is good but it has kinda yellowish screen which I think they can fix it by software update.
The Best
Thanks Flipkart for extending best discounts :)A must have gadget for all
This is my Ist experience with i phone. And its great. Timely delivery.
This is my first iPhone I got excited how it is but it is simply excellent

Bestest phone I have seen Ever....
Awesome Display. Nice Camera. Smooth Performance
"Overall a good phone but camera is not as it was hyped. May be software update can change the camera quality. Specifically, the portrait edge detection is not at all good. Other than that the build and finish is excellent. Display is very good. The phone is responsive. Overall a very good phone but not a phone to be priced above 60 - 65K for 128 GB."
upgraded from iphone 7 good phone but overpriced
Camera its awesome and performance is too good battery life is also good If you are a heavy user than you have you to charge 2 or 3 time & normal user charge once in a day. Display is awesome I love you phone
I really appreciate the product and the camera is unbeatable i really the processsor and i am just being to say that if you have low budget go for it
Good
Camera is good
Who does hate an iPhone?
Killer phone
camera and performance no words! but phone just gets over heats. And baterry
Smoothly work amazing product
Just lovin it
Great product
Best phone
This is the best iphone to buy compared to 12 pro.Black colour is way better than blueScreen is quad hd and not full hd which is found in samsung s21 plus at the same price range.Rest functioning is buttery smoothFace id works like charmDon’t worry of smudges as they are not that prominent if u are looking at phone directly but in 12 category i think you should go for only this colour option besides white.Matt sides are good  for handling and there are no smudge problem there.
Good product but battery like a cell
Wide angle pic.
Good
Very good
I am giving the review with my iPhone 12 I think I should not say anything about this because we know better about iPhone.
"Iphone 12 is just like other phones. If you wanna swag for that iphone logo then only go for it. Yes, of course the camera is awesome. But, I didn't feel anything else was very special. Miss you Jobs."
Excellent but you use it only 4to 5 hrs only.
Camera performance is next level but i think in 2024 this phone not good for performance
Fantastic
As usual iphone 5S feeling just needed to work on Battery  performance if moderate used will last a day
Very Nice Cool and Unique Design
Camera OSM
"This is my 1st iPhone and I really liked its camera quality, performance and design.Battery quality is decent ."
Product is very nice
iPhone plz increase your battery performance in update... It's drain without using
Very good
Phone is good but under 54k is overrated in my opinion if u have 4k extra go for iPhone 13 better storage and upgrade device if u have tight budget this phone is good for u nd specially u have ios user totally amazing performance
Fine
Nice look and everything is good. Sometimes while charging it is heating at ambient temperature environment. And charging backup lessOther than everything is super
Very good
Best device for ever but there are slite problems in this device and battery performance is low
"The iPhone 12 sports a gorgeous design, great cameras and strong performance."
No complaints . Powerful & crisp phone
"It's an amazing. I have purchased thru Flipkart. Well packed, Timely & so well delivered . Value for money ."
Everything is perfect except the display refresh rate.They give only 60hzRF that is not so smooth after using a 120hzRf.
Overall great phone
nice phone by realme
Nice phone
"Great phone, with a nice camera, iPhone needs to make phone affordable also."
Good
NICE
"Nothing to say its Iphone, Camera good, Display good, Multi tasking good, Battery good,  updates regularly water and dust resistance what else you want Premium"
Only for camera. Android is much easier to use for daily purpose.
Worth the price
Iphone 12  is of overall best qwality. But full payment taken by credit card on flipkart not converted to emi
iPhone 12 is a good smartphone everything is alright it gives privacy and protection also but the problem is battery life becomes very low after sometime otherwise the phone is is a complete set with all features and in my opinion I love the look of the product
Superb
Camera goodSoftware goodOverall good.
Good mobile look
Nice product
everything  thing is supperbbb... but battery perfomen is not satisfied  .it's only good.
Quick delivery and great price
Go for the 128GB one. The OS itself occupies 18GB.
My 1st iPhone...Loved it
Good phone. But for most of the app in apple store or for playing music - we have to pay
Value for money…great phone but only lacking is finger print sensor during these pandemic time.
Very nyc .
Nice phone but little overpriced.
Good camera like it
"U can never say bad things about iphone..extraordinary,  only thing is people like more if it would've slim & thinner.."
"Awesome camera, awesome battery life and amazing speed. The size is perfect for someone looking for a phone that fits comfortably in the pocket and in the hand. Suitable for one handed use.Sound could have been slightly better but not a major issue.Wish apple had to provide a complete charger."
Power Pack But Generally IPhone Less Battery Backup Heavy User's You Will Get 4Hours For BGMI Normal Usage Like Phone Calls And What's app And General Use You will Get 1 Day Backup But Performance Was Awesome
Just love it
"Good Phone but miss zoom photos on it, 5x digital zoom is not enough; battery is surprisingly good and better than 4500 mah battery of Android phones."
Good phone
First of all i was very afraid to buy from online services cause so many people are saying that do not buy a phone from online services all of that but the price flipkart offered in the sale it was  awesome and i couldn't refused it and i ordered iphone 12 and now i am  Fully satisfied after the experienced i can say that buying an iphone from Flipkart its very safe just u need to follow some steps to ensure your delivery safe thats all
"One of the best. smooth AF. Performance is top notch. I was using One plus earlier and used to play PUBG but this phone takes the gaming to another level. BUT, the game crashed a couple of times recently in my iPhone 12 and before crashing it got stuck also which is a matter of concern & raises the eye in suspicion. I got this deal cheap in the BB days, but if you are going to buy it on its original price, it is not worth it."
Loved it But batter is not good.Camera 100% super.Performance is awesome.
excellent product Screen quality is awesome
Nice
It’s amazing
"Writing this review post 1 month of usage.Firstly, I appreciate flipkart in delivering the product within the agreed TAT.  The packaging was good. Received the product in good shape and order.Camera : I would rate 3/5 ( may be I expected the pic quality to be like Apple 13)Sound: 5/5. There are no issues with the sound quality and speakersBattery: Well, I was surprised to see a very good battery backup. I charge it once in a day and by the end of the day the battery is used only 30%.  ...READ MORE"

Upgraded  x - ip12Pros -1-Processor is so good2-Good light weight phone3-Sound quality is too good4-Happy with displayCons - 1-Camera is little bit yellowish ( 3/5 rating)2- Apple needs to improve its charging power approx 30w
Upgrade from 6s it is blazing fast. Camera is not so good as they claimed for night picture battery backup is 6 -8 hours continuous work with high contrast
Front camera was not up to mark but other than that phone was superb it was worth when you buy in big billion days

"Overall awesome product...1. My first ios experience the reason i given 4 stars is camera everyone says iphone camera is just lit but its not that good...2. Camera is somewhat okay not better than vivo v17 pro or other flagships of the same price (in comparison)...3.

Camera quality
Awesome device .Buttersmooth experiance with this device.Camera is Awesome.Battery life is always super.
"Looks very nice, but display quality, I think flagship androids are much much better than this. Even the camera quality of flagship android are better when compared to this iPhone 12 model only. (not for pro or pro max). Over all a good deal at 47k.Overall it is Apple"
at the cost of 53k it’s worth buying
Genuine product. Been using from last 2 months. Working fine.
No value for money
Its all about moneyMore sugar more sweet
Absolutely stunning phone… loved it
"Found cardbox box opened and iPhone box not sealed well, but phone works fine"
"Needless to say anything about the iPhone. It sure comes with a price range but if you have invested so much of money then there is no point of giving any negative feedback for obvious reasons.Though just wanted to point out the delivery segment that flipkart delivers. The delivery guys are the worst. Its good that they are providing us by delivering the products but the management system is what i want to talk about. Since the high price range mobiles comes with Open Box delivery, but the...READ MORE"
best phone
No doubt its very good product and also a great deal for me thank you Flipkart !!but i m experiencing heating problem of back side after clicking 10-12 images continuously.
Should increase battery capacity else it would have been a value for money product
Good
"Good , working fine.."
Nice mobile from apple
Nice
This phone is not for 5g and video call if you do that your phone overheat and battery drain in 2 to 3 hours.
"Good quality, fast service, but price is high give more discount on this product."
The Battery performance is pathetic. It lasts only 8 hours. Overall it’s a very good Phone.
Writing after 7 months of use.. its amazing no any doubt abt all specifications but now my phone is getting stuck cant call it as a hang or lagging but it stucks at some point for a few seconds and also Home Screen was unable to scroll one day.. believe it or not.. it’s iPhone 12(128gb) from flipkart
"Good camera, battery, display and performance!"
Bang for buck at 57K. Bought the product during big billion day sale 2021. Performance is amazing. No lag at all. Camera is excellent during the day. But I expected more in low light shots. Not up to the mark as all the YouTubers say. Battery is average. But over all extremely value for money at 57K
Not so comfortable
"Yes yes yes, I was planning for 1 year to purchase a good iPhone but fortunately I got this iphone 12 (128) Variant which is beyond my expectation, only 51 k with the charger. Thank you Flipkart to provide me a super opportunity to get it owned."
"Phone is good but battery performance is very bad, iPhone 11 battery is better than iPhone 12"
Phone is good but if you using Samsung flagship like s10 s20 note 10 do not buy iPhone you will disappointed Samsung display and front facing camera is far better.
Delivery was pretty fast.Got the phone with 24 hr.Totally loved the iphone
"Spent around 50k, the phone is beautiful in every way but it has some serious flaws as well.. Camera doesn't have pause button can you imagine? While incoming calls you cant get option to reject the calls.. calculator doesn't have history option.. no pro option in camera though video and photo quality is top notch. Found some very unique features and love them but still finding not worth 50k phone.."
Very weak battery back up fully charged battery empty in 6 -7 hours normal using
After switching from 6s I realised the super phone is this one iphone12. It’s display feels like a liquid with the finger swipe. Awesome to avail with an offer.
Worst experience. Battery performance is very poor. Phone getting heat in one call only.  I will not advise to buy online.  After sale no support from Flipkart.Better to buy from store.  At least you will get genuine product.
Excellent battery life - for non gamer like me and great camerareceived the product in 24 hr of ordering without any extra charge......Amazon asks for extra money for same.....thanks Flipkart
"Everything is fine can live without a higher refresh display but the battery life is not satisfactory.batter life could be better to make it a perfect flagship, moderate to heavy users need to charge it twice. Overall a good product."
Battery backup is worse
Super but price not afordable for poor peoples

Loving the mobile
I’m using this device since more than a week and performance wise this device is amazing. Camera is awesome. Battery is also good. This phone makes you feel nostalgic as look wise this is similar to iPhone 5.Price is the only issue otherwise go for it.
Elegant!
"First time I purchased a smartphone on Flipkart and my experience is awesome. I received genuine product and delivery of product is within time frame. I’m an android user and first time switched to IOS, iPhone 12 is up above my expectations and happy to have it. I got a great deal from Flipkart. Thanks Flipkart team for blast past fast deal."
Perfect Just go for ItIts 80% better then 11Display is just EXCELLENTBattery is OK
Beyond expectations
Mind blowing value fot money
Low qualityColour IssueDo not by online  iphonePlease  Do not  by
Flipkart really provides a very good service. Rating for their service- 5 starFor product- I say just after 1 day i am not happy with IOS. Very hard to use OS. Android provides much better features and ease-to use
"One of the best displays around 50k right now. The camera is simply superb. Only drawback is the battery, wish it was better. Currently am getting around 7hrs of screen on time. It easily lasts a day but still I wish it's bigger. I used to be sceptical about apple's pricing but now I come to appreciate the build and os"
"Apple Phones are always overpriced, if you like apple logo backside your phone go for it otherwise 20k, 30k android phones are equally good."
"About Flipkart & e kart it’s worst delivery ever during big billion day. About phone after using 10days not great everything is. Average Display, Medium Dolby sound battery back up was half day continuously if we use,overall average impression."
It’s good

Good products in big billions days
It's such an amazing phone. Camera quality and screen is just superb. Performance is mind blowing. Really it's a wonderful experience. Thanks to Flipkart for delivering next day itself
Battery need to improve moreCamera was godDisplay was awesomeDesign was perfect for officials usePerformance was goodAfter using 3 months I am sharing this feedback
iPhone means iPhone is the number one mobile in the world .Awesome phone . Thank u Flipkart
Really good product
Awesome picture photography.
Absolutely gorgeous...My 3rd iphone.
"This mobile does not need any introduction, only issue I feel is a bit of heating while playing COD mobile for long duration. Image quality is great specially in good lighting conditions. Battery could be better for playing games"
Product was awesome. I love the smoothness of screen . Somewhere it got heated while charging.
"I bought this iPhone for my brother more than 2 years back. He loves it and still using it as his daily driver. It is an absolute winner. Its sleek design, impressive A14 Bionic chip, and Ceramic Shield front cover are remarkable. The Super Retina XDR display is vibrant and sharp, perfect for media consumption. 5G capability adds to the future-proofing. Camera improvements deliver stunning photos, especially in low light. No lags at all ever after all these years."
"I am writing this review after using for a yearPhone does not lag and stuck ,Camera is okay . Only problem is Phone heats up easily"

Awesome camera
Super quality and design was simply osm mobile is super performance
I am at loss of words to explain the features of Apple phone

Camera good 4/5Proformance good 5/5Display average 4/5Battery 3/5
"I honestly bought this phone only for PUBG and you know the challenges right if you play a lot your battery will degrade since 12 as very low compare to 13 and 13 pro you need to recharge every time it’s been 6 months my battery health got reduced from 100% to 98% , so my suggestion would be go for iPhone 13 and (also after some games phone was getting too hot which is expected )"
Battery health reduced to 99% in a month.
"Only concern is battery, rest is okay!!"
Great phone camara is supper
"I am writing this review after 4 months of use. Flipkart undoubtedly is a best place for deals. Bought at 58K on time, the device was genuine & delivered perfectly. No comparison of iPhone with any Mobile when it comes to performance & camera. Though it’s 60Hz refresh rate display but far better than 60Hz android display. Display size is perfect, not to small not too tall, aspect ratio (WH) is ideal. Only caution for persons migrating from Android to iOS that Android is very user friendly so ...READ MORE"
"Just go for it!People who are complaining for battery life are probably heavy gamers!If you are a social media buff, does video call to family! Checks emails. Would easily go for 1 days!While I type this my battery % is 13 after 34 hours!Camera is brilliant!"
Amazing
Working so nice I have ordered 2 iPhone 12 working good
It’s a very good phone
Osm product
"It is good but with that expensive smartphone at least an charger,ear phones , back cover should be provided out of which we get nothing and it has no good feature other then camera performance and  showoff!"
Now I realised why apple products are costliest.The feeling of using iPhone is seamless.
I am soo in love with the user experience & camera quality. Night mode works like charm
Mind blowing I phone
All are good camera Display performance value of mony

"Amazing display, camera could have been better. In total beautiful smooth phone."
Good one
"This is my first iphone, been an android user difficult initially, but getting used to it. Performance is smooth. Overall satisfied with my purchase"
The best iPhone you can get at this price range. Camera is amazing and the battery backup is excellent. Performance is buttery smooth and fast. Just go for it if you are willing to get one.
"Tried with all the settings,not able access through iMessages and FaceTime.Software is updated too.but still same issue!!"
Excellent as always. Made in India. Smooth fast and looks great.

Loving the switch from an Android. Very smooth to use. Battery performance could be better but I do use it extensively also. Size is also perfect and love the purple colour.
Genuine Product.Thanks for the fast delivery flipkart.Excellent device.
I loved it
simply awesome.....
best phone
No comparison when it comes to iPhone. So far iPhone 12 is the best!
How can one complain about iPhone performance. As amazing as always. The low light photos are brilliant. Best thing about iPhones is that they dont slow down even after 4-5 years of use.
Black beast amazing mobile
The phone is fine for a professional use not heavy usage . I get around 1.5 days of charge
"Amazing Phone, lightening fast.Pros;Great DisplayBuildFeel in handSpeedCameraCons;Battery life is not as claimed if you are a heavy user.No power adapter"

Got it for 53K.  Upgraded from Oneplus 7. Good software. Very smooth and lag free. No heating issue while using. Video clarity is really great. Battery is good for one day of heavy usage. I used to end up my busy schedule at 6pm with around 30% batteryCompared to Oneplus 7 still camera is lack of colours. I felt like all photos washed out of colours. Front camera is really bad. Display also lack of good punch in terms of colours. My Oneplus life was really colourful in-terms of camera an...READ MORE

"Reviewing after 5 days of use .. Overall it’s a complete package of all species , good phone but facing a little hitting issue while charging ."
I bought 20W adapter from Apple online store but phone heating issue during charging.
Nice phone and only for apple user who know how to use apple phone
Super phone
Best phone of apple ever.
Not good as my Nothing Phone 1. Waste of money
Ooo my doggy style what a heating issue like a heaterHaiii garmiiiiiiiii
You already all know what iphone is so am not gonna  write a any word
"Thank you Flipkart for providing big billion days..Nice mobile with Excellent performance,camera, display"
Apple iphone 12 64GB nice phone and performance is great
Its just iphone  i cant give any bad reviews on that product.. because of  disply quality awesome  and camera we don’t have to compare with other mobiles or google pixel 6a .. it’s different .. may be battery is normal like not bad ..
The phone is awesome. I am using it for last 2 months. It's performance is great. Camera performance is great. Battery is lasting for 2 days in a charge. So battery backup is good. Siri works so fine that I have been it's regular user. But there is some heating issue while charging and while using in sun. Rest all things are good.
Phone is good but cost is high.
"Phone is perfect, go for it, Battery life good, it will give you enough one full day power with moderate usage. Camera is awesome. Overall it’s great."
Nice one
Mobile is too good but charger earphone & mobile cover messing
"Phone is gud,but the quality of the camera is not up to the mark"
Awesome! Great design and camera. IOS is just unbelievable.
"Excellent camera, plus status symbol"
I am not satisfied with apple phone without charger get separate charger means not complit phone.what meaning 54000 pay for without charger phone
"Overall good mobile, apart from so called big brand, nothing special in it.Camera is gud but not wow like Samsung s21+or ultra which I am currently using. Yes performance is really top class. You will not see any lag. Battery could have be better."
Overall performance great  but battery is low performance
Ordered in 2021 still using in 2024 best iphone i can say
Poor battery leif
Overall good product but i am highly disappointed with its battery I have to charge it at least twice to trice a dayCamera is ok
After using the product for 2 months battery backup is very bad.System is very slow which I didn't expected form Apple.While charging phone is very hear.Remaining normal.
Battery heating
"Awesome product, but battery life is too short."
Battery draining frequently without usage
"Camera is good , Display is good apart from that battery performance too low"
product is not proper workingproblem is tough screen is not working from today
Better is very bad ...and hitting problem
Battery life is not perfect
Battery back is very low.
Everything is good except battery backup. Have to put in charge twice for a day.
Good camera decent performance nice design.. overall a win win situation with this device so far (2 years)..Can go for it if budget bound..
Bettery performance is NT good
Product is excellent but Flipkart service is poor
"IPhone 12 really awesome product, but delivery was delayed."
Awesome phone
"Phone is good but camera is not that great when it comes to taking still photos specifically in low lighting conditions, battery drain very quick of you play intense gaming, heating a lot"
"1.Performance is wonderful.2.Battery backup also good.3.From 12 Series onwards display is wonderful.4.Such a powerful speaker provided and I’m very happy to listen music in iphone 125.Camera is not good, while zooming photos are blurry.Overall I’m satisfied but I’m not happy with iPhone 12 Camera…"
Phone is excellent.. Camera quality is excellent and there is no overheating while charging. Always research about the apple accessories before purchasing and also spend good amount of money in its accessories for long term durability
Phone’s camera is not working properlyThe screen is running
Android is better then iOS.
Good performance phone.
"You removed ear phones, then you removed charger, now you gave useless cable with C-Pin on one side and lightning port on one side. Next don’t give phone ask users to imagine phone. Pathetic."
Phone is average performance & battery continues using only 4-5 hours working
It Emits a Large amount of heat during charging.
Perfect
The camera is perfect and the phone looks really cool. Loved it. Reducing one star for the battery because it drains a bit fast. Otherwise it's perfect!
Automatically wife on
Satisfied with camera
"Got my first Apple smartphone from flipkart. The device very good in terms of performance and quality...Anyone can easily switch from android to iOS..Thank you flipkart. Be my shopping destination  .1,"
"Battery drains real quick.. if you are using mobile data,this is not the mobile for you.. it uses so much of data due to the quality of videos and everything… but mobile is fast and camera is perfect.. looks premium very comfortable to use.."
Awesome product
"The phone is terrific... but the charging  cable was not working which came along with the i phone 12,  i had to go out to purchase another one in a near by store"
Good mobile
Best for money investment 
Best ever iPhone experience with iPhone 12. Go for it.
"Seriously I didn’t the camera quality better, I was using 6 and now moved to 12 but 6 camera quality is good in terms of worth of the product however overall product is really nice"
Feeling blessed even after paid full amount for the product.Amazing Mobile. Encashed more than paid.Thaks Flipkart for timely delivery .
It’s an amazing photo. Looks nice feels nice and great to use. Extremely lightweight for hand and pocket. Perfect size for one hand usage.
"Camera is great, specially night shots.I am getting more than a day of battery back up with my usage. I don’t play games.Performance is top notch.Being in Apple ecosystem from 10 years it’s a habit you can change anymore."
It's just ok.. camera is not as good as people sayIt's not worth spending huge amount. Build quality is good.. looks ok.. screen is good.. battery worst..charging speed poorUsability ok ok..
"The phone’s battery is not at all comparable to One Plus. Comparing with 9R. The charging is very slow even with genuine 20w apple charger. And battery drainage is much higher.FYI, I am a normal user and neither I have not yet installed any game, nor I am a heavy video viewer or something. So, even normal usage won’t give more than 20 hours anyhow… Apple is betraying customer in this aspect!Rest other aspects are 5*"
Product is very nice….Really fantastic feeling when we use iPhone…Camera Quality is awesome…everyone wants my phone to capture his/her pictures…I never observed this things when im using before any other company phones….but screen is small i feels… u can prefer i phone 12 pro max for larger display but price is too high…Previous im using i phone 6 plus which has larger display….Very much thanks for Flipkart who gave original i phone 12 and prompt delivery…Appreciated…
Sprb
Loved it…. Camera mind blowing
Bought ahead of iPhone 13. Saved 10k Feeling so happy with the butter smooth performances
"Ok here’s the thing. The only thing apart from the charger that will probably make you think twice ‘why apple, you could have at least added this’ is the Apple earphones. At least a wired one. That’s not much of an impact but at one moment it will for sure hit you. Otherwise it’s an amazing phone. The best so far."
Facing problem with network with airtel simPhone faulty

Although phone is good little bit heating issue while charging and camera is too good but battery drains too much fast I suggest you all to use 40~80 battery trick to maintain battery health

Camera quality is awesome but also missing the professional mode. Battery also good. Awesome display approximately i love this phone but still missing the professional mode.

Failed product from Apple.iPhone 12 has a lot of issues that's why they are discontinuing this product.I'm facing lot of issues like:1. Face Detection is not working2. SIM card doesn't work properly3. Touch Screen Issues4. Front Camera not working5. Producing radiation abnormallyJust one question for Apple. Why are they discontinuing this product when older iPhones are still in production?This was my last product from Apple.

"I have chatted with flipkart executive and senior executive 10 to 12 times continuously since last 5-6 days and also chatted with flipkart support assistant for 5-6 days in a row and I did iphone 12 red even before the return policy expires  There is a request for the iPhone 12 Blue color exchange, but I am being given the replacement of the iPhone 12 Red color again and again.  This is quite frustrating for a plus member.  Is there no solution for this?  very disappointed."

"Awesome mobile, awesome camera, awesome performance."
First off all heating problem and battery performance is very bad
"Apart from the pathetic delivery experience, Iam enjoying the phone. It has wonderful camera, initially I thought it will be difficult to move from Android to IOS, but it’s very easy to use."
It heats up when use not even heavy use without installing any app it get heats up.Turn on camera and within 2-3 mins heating.Done software update but no use.Waiting for replacement. God knows whether i will get better one or not
Product is good(ofcourse it’s apple) but the seller failed to deliver the product on time and literally took 13 days to deliver! Not happy with this. Atleast you should then provide some discount or restitution in case of failure of promise.
Amazing proud
Nice phone. Battery backup could be better. Camera is decent could have been better. Over all nice phone..

Switching from android to iOS is an amazing experience so far …
Nice product fully satisfying performance.Thought of getting fake iphone but not.
I have been used from last 15 days iPhone is really improved now i think when you are going to change your within 70000 then go for iPhone because size is so comfortable and no doubt on processing its one time investment for next 5 to 7 years
Very Nice thanks Flipkart
"I ordered this phone for a birthday gift the birthday was on 19th January and I got the delivery on 21st January delayed delivery was completely disappointing factor for me I attended the party without any surprise gift it was worst experience of my life because I had already paid the amount of this mobile phone by my credit card I would give Flipkart zero rating for their worst courier services, apart from this bad experience everything is good related to iPhone 12"

"Apple is best phone you can ever get. Its worhty to experience it. Just one expectations in camera, It should allow in settings take pictures with beauty mode rather than only focusing on image quality and expexted more editing option to enhance picture fairness. portrait mode edge detection should have been more precise."

If I click photos against any lights  sun daylight or at night time artificial lights I see green dot and  green lines kind of issue. See my photos which I have taken from my iPhone 12...READ MORE"

"I love this product considering all the previous versions of apple phones I used. This is compact, compatible and almost light weight. I'd highly recommend this to someone who is not a huge fan of taking pictures always and only want to use it for communication purposes. Camera quality is also good but I'd miss the cinematic option in here ( I know it's already there in 13 variant ).All over, I am satisfied."

Beast phone …. Camera is exceptionally best
I upgraded to 13 from xs and my experience with this had been extraordinary . The user interface and the camera is too good .Just in love with this extraordinary device .I just shared some photos clicked from this phone so that everyone can have an idea about how good the camera is compared all other flagship devices . The lens inside the device is so efficient that it  automatically reduces the noise in the picture making it very crisp and clear  .
Love this phone.....
Best phone available at this price point.Camera is comparable with entry level DSLR(marvellous dynamic range)The performance is unmatchable.Shifted to iOS after 10 years of premium android smartphones.Go  for it without any second thought.

Great
Best purchase ever and first phone
will gift i phone 13  to my wife..
Camera is next level.. Battery backup is also good .. Satisfied with product.. Worth I phone.. Just goo for it
The product received was good but the delivery boy 'Susanta Sasmal' was very rude and threatened while exchanging the old phone. He intentionally scratched the mobile and reduced the value.
Phone experience good
Overall great product
The most premium feeling I ever had while holding a phone was of this iphone 13.This is my first iPhone apart from having ipad pro but i can guarentee you that it had the most premium in hand experience.The flipkart service was awesome and it got delivered before expected date. Hats off!Overall an excellent experience it was. An iphone is not hyped just for no reason.
Awesome PHONE ALWAYS BEEN A IOS FAN
What to say its  iphone
Camera is just absolutely brilliant. Check attached pics.Battery lasts for around 7-8 hours even with heavy usage. Light usage it will last longer. Performance wise absolutely banger. If any con there could be is only the notch. Just don’t forget to get screen guard and back cover before you get the phone.Starlight is color absolutely dreamy and gorgeous.
Quality is quite good SatisfiedBtw iPhone is a phone which increases the photo quality nothing else
"First of all, this is a nice switch from Android in terms of software experience and optimizations.The kind of performance this iPhone offers is incredible. Even though this one is not having high screen refresh rates, it performs well compared to most of the android devices. Camera performance is fantastic, especially the cinematic mode is whole new experience.So far, under minimal calls, normal usage (like checking notifications atleast once in an hour), atleast 2 hours of streaming video...READ MORE"
I moved from android to iPhone and I love it's camera most the design and performance is also superb worth every penny.
Great Camera
Truly a superpower..Beast phoneCamera and battery is 11/10Just brilliant
"1st time using an iPhone. Didn’t expect to blend in so easily. Though it is different from android, however the system is still easy to use and super responsive. Having said that, there are still few functions in android that makes it easy to use and coming from android having need to pay for everything also is a new experience"
Elegance design iPhone 13....

Good decision for 13 super camera
Pink is Most beautiful color in iPhone 13
A top notch! I’ve upgraded to it from iPhone 11. iPhone 13 is by far the most flawlessly performing piece of quality hardware & software in a phone in 2022. Totally worth the money!
"best performance , camera is mind boggling"
Very nice
"Wonderful device. If you have some more budget go for 256GB which I bought. The Blue colour is nice.Its a bit thicker but doesn’t feel. Very handy design.I was a android user but after using this i am fan of Apple.Now screen, Huge update from 12. Its more bright more resolution more details.Sound quality is good but not very loud.Camera is awesome. Video is at it best. Due to sensor shift stabilisation low light photography is very good and easy.OS and CPU performance is mind blowing.I...READ MORE"

Amazing quality camera
"Every smartphone is essentially made up of 3 basic hardware things which when done right results in great experience. Speed, battery and screen.1. Speed: Even though the chip is one generation old its still way ahead than others in the market. You wont get a lag in day to fay activities. Its the same chip from base iPhone 14 series.2.

"At first I was little bit confused about the colour choice finally I ordered Midnight, I think these is the best colour because it's not totally black it is dark greenish blue.I think I don't have to tell about the design of Apple because it's very popular from decades.you can feel and also see the PC which is used to make this premium device.1 The display of this device is absolutely stunning because when the screen is turned of then you cannot even see the bezel because the display is so...READ MORE"

To keep iPhone was a big dream to me... At last i have fulfilled my dream.... Thanks to Flipkart... I am very happy.... And iPhone 13 totally superb... And features is more and good
"In terms of build quality, there is not an inch about this phone which can be faulted. The new camera system and battery life are superb to say the least. I wish the charging speed was atleast 25W but maybe when iphones become USB-C we can finally dream about it. Now a few gripes, I just shifted from android to iOS and while iOS in terms of speed and optimisation is miles more polished, android is far greater in terms of ease of use and variability.1. I cannot right swipe to go back as I c...READ MORE"
"Holding a Apple product always looks premium, loved its performance till now. Battery quality could be better, notch on the top of the screen looks old now. Overall a good product but little overpriced."
"this is my first time buying an Apple Product, I dont know much about it..... but it look genuine to me.....its hard being new to iphone u cuz you know, everything is different from that of an android smartphone..... you know what, i was searching for the mobile data button for 3 hrs.... thanks flipkart, it was worth it"
Before this I used to buy iPhone 11 but its camera is better than 11 and its value for money.
iPhone
"One of the most elegant product, green colour is very nice and attractive, loving the phone very much. Just a little concern for the battery only. Lasts only 20-24 hours after full charge with minimal usage"
After using iphone 6s Upgrade to Iphone 13. Very happy with the Performance.

"Excellent performance,  excellent camera and audio quality. Only that front design could have been better in terms of bezel and notch. I own a samsung s20+ which looks better in front screen design but other than that everything is top notch in iphone 13."
"This was my first IOS device and i loved it hope you do too….it’s overall great. As i have heard my friends crying over iphone battery, it’s not that bad….it’s good but can’t compare it with android but still its good…."

Awesome product.... I'm fully satisfied with this product....!!
"I was an ANDROID USER earlier.Major disappointment - CAMERA GOES BLURRY when you try to focus in very CLOSE RANGE.I have checked online and it seems the issue known to everyone.It seems the Iphone 13 does not focus at all at close range because iphone pro and pro max  have Macro feature in the camera (When you take camera very closer to an object, it zooms in and gives you more detail). SERIOUSLY??? Why do you have to remove the focus or make the camera blurry?Second disappointment -...READ MORE"

"The new iPhone’s display is brighter than its predecessor’s. The battery life is longer. And Apple has improved an already great camera with new sensors and computational photography features that make you feel like a pro (even on a non-Pro phone).Yes, the A15 Bionic powering the iPhone 13 is once again the fastest chip in the land. But it’s more about what this chip lets you do. This includes Cinematic mode, which adds depth of field to your videos while automatically shifting focus, and Ph...READ MORE"

Tried samsung, note 20 but they slow down their phones by giving updates. Tried oneplus 9r, oxygen os is as good as any custom rom, but not now as its color os, its of no use.

No need of a review excellent
People using iphone12 it's not worth it to updated to 13. It's basically the same phone. Go on for Pro models.
Got the device on BBD sale at the lowest revealed price and got delivered next day. The product is genuine and working perfectly fine.The service provided by Flipkart is excellent and fastest delivery.
Nice phone. But really disappointed by Flipkart as placing order during the BBD sale was a worst experience. Tried continuously for 2hrs then I was able to get my order placed.
Very good
Good performance!
"Upgraded from 6s to 13. Good performance, great look. Overall had a good experience. Camera 5/5, especially cinematic mode. Go for it"
"Did not liked the camera, difference is noticeable between pro max and standard iphone 13.Performance, build quality and display is top top level.Battery backup is terrific good but basic charging and playing heavy games heats the phone on left side.So overall 4* from my side."
Good
massiveloved it IP 13
Loved with the product very nice device in 2024 also
Amazin user interface
Amazing Product what can be said about Apple especially buying after 2 years it's still relevant and pocket-friendly. Will get updates and the latest OS till 2026 and that's still good enough.
"This is my 3rd iPhone but best till now!!Power house in deedSmoothness of ios is far far aheadAlmost a year in use, no issues at all.I wish it had just a longer battery life and 120 hz display.."

Very good experience to having I phone
Very good product and very nice delivery
Awesome experience
Almost using 1 year .. one think can say battery backup little bit disappointed. Otherwise everything i love in this phone!
Just an absolute beast. Got it for 50k in sale. Shifting from android to ios took a litkle time but the experience is amazing. The most loved part is camera and performance. Not playing games overall experience is good so far.
You wont carry Dslr if you have an Iphone with you.
Amazing
Switched from Android to iOSJust loved the camera performance and display in this phone
Awesome phone. Was tired of using bigger display android phones. Got it for 48k in BBD sale. Switched from android to ios. Used android for almost 12 yrs and was confused to switch to ios but now ios is awesome and equally user friendly. Ios is rather fluid and faster.
AWESOME PHONE
Overall good experience best design and all love to buy a iphone .
No comments required for iPhone still have heating issues with this phone. Should be resolved
nice camera quality. value for money
"Wonderful camera and display,  i get 24 hrs battery backup if we switch off the location toggle."
Switching to iOS after Android was a bit weird for me at first but it was such an amazing experience for me. The display looks so crisp and wonderful and the phone never fails to amaze me. The battery life is something that could be better but it is still good enough for hours of gaming or bingeing. I am really glad I chose iPhone 13 as my first iPhone ever :)

Very fast delivery thnx for flipkart.Camera is to goodBattery performance are excellentI am happy for this produvlct

Best in the world and 'WAY BETTER THAN ANY ANDROID GAMING PHONE' ."

All good but 13 camera lacking somewhere if we compare with Android with this price segment

"It was an upgrade for me from my iPhone 8 to the iPhone 13. Just loving the way it performs and for those who says itz too costly, a newly bought iPhone serves seamlessly for another 2 or 3 years. And an investment that you make for 3 years is worth every penny."
"Beautiful product. if you can afford, please go for it. They could have added finger print also."

"Really the iPhone 13 is best one.I had dream to buy it.it is far better than any other phone.But one thing, the company must provide the  wireless charger with this phone."
What an Iphone. The best Apple could do till date. It has probably everything which a smart phone user needs and more. I have moved to Apple from Android and I AM LOVING IT. The smoothness even at 60hz is unmatched with Android's 120hz speed. The peace of mind with Apple security is brilliant. The only thing is about investing in chargers and cables and cases when you move from Android. But these are built to last for atleast 4 years and maximum 5 years. I guess NO android can match this dura...READ MORE

Initially read preferring Asus 9, then moto 30pro, then for Google pixel 7/pro.. finally fell into iPhone well, that's because of the quality and the service.

"This device offers excellent features, however, it is not recommended for purchase due to the reduction in camera quality and battery life. Despite these drawbacks, the build quality is robust and superior to the latest iPhone model."
"Design feels premium, I have upgraded from iphone xr to 13 and I must say the performance is phenomenal. The camera is just amazing but the battery still felt a bit on lower side. Apart from this everything is perfect."
Best product but Flipkart delivery process is very bad.

My first iPhone. So it’ll be slightly biased.Feels pretty fluid to use.Receives excellent coverage even when other phones tumble a bit.Excellent voice quality over callsBattery life could be a bummer for heavy usersPlays smoothly with whatever you throw at itPretty happy with the purchaseThe display is nice. Would have been great if they have the 120hz display. Not that I’m able to notice it but people used to those might notice a difference

Happy to have this phone
"Smooth and fast, easy to hold and efficient battery work"
"It’s my first iPhone and I am very much eager to get it on hand. First impression ya it’s great phone by look.Good weight balance,great optimised chip ,and good battery back up.and now the things I am not impress with the price point is it’s display,ya it’s display is good but not up to the mark for the price.and camera samples not even comparable with Samsung A SERIES…I am also using Samsung A 52."
Awesome
Elegant piece.
"I've never left a review before, but I couldn't resist sharing my experience with Flipkart for the purchase of two iPhone 13 Midnight 128GB units. The whole process was outstanding. Flipkart delivered them incredibly fast, and the price I got them for was unmatched. The delivery person was courteous and helpful, and Flipkart's open-box delivery service was a great touch. Kudos to Flipkart! The Big Billion Day sale is truly fantastic."
If you want camera and performance buy it but if you want battery long lasting then change your choice
Very user friendly phone . Camera is a very goodi like colour Green
Everything ok but battery not satisfied

For some reason I see that my mobile signal is weak, this was not the case with my android phone.Second the IOS: I didn’t find it amusing. From a customisation perspective it is probable 5 years behind android. There are certain simple things are missing, it’s a long list. But from a RAM and battery management, it is outstanding.

"This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium.

Mini was the most appropriately sized phone ever after soo long. Still rocking it after almost 2 years of purchase with 87% of battery health left. Never had any issues with the device. I always get a number of compliments in public when they see the such a handy device. The battery lasts as long as the regular iPhone 12. I wish apple releases another similarly sized devices in the future.

"Excellent performance of iPhone 13.Display is extremely crisp.

Also, I was skeptical initially about buying this from Flipkart, but now after using the phone for 3 months, rest assured the phone is very much genuine and working perfectly."

"Awesome mobile, higher performance , best camera quality , thanks BBD sales flipkart"
Received genuine product from Flipkart.
Awesome
A long time investment worth having. Totally satisfied with the performance and feel.
good one
"Bought this in BBD sale. iPhone 13 Blue 256GB for 59990. Best purchase I have made in a long time. I don't upgrade my phone frequently, so I hope this one will last me the next 6yrs. One small thing I have noticed within a week is the simplicity of android in some instances.  Especially volume control"

"Being an android user for years, switiching to iphone was easy. Iphone 13 is a great all round phone with great screen, cameras, battery and performance.Loved the purchase."
Verry good cameras
Happy that I received geniune product from Flipkart on the date specified had negative thoughts post reading on social media and feeling lucky that I got one in BigbillionDays for 51k. Thanks Flipkart

"Mobile is very good, camera and performance is the best thing."
The camera is really amazing. Butter smooth performance. In Low light it captures well. Addictive display quality. Totally paisa wasool product. Speed is rocket speed.
Best mobile
"Great display, with great specs loved it"
Very good phone. Looks very elegant
Worth it
Display and camera could have been better.Samsung flagship at the same price beats it so so easily. If not for notchless atleast 120 hz in todays era is a must for this proce. Camera day time performance is the best but lacks zoom capabilities.I absolutely hate the selfy cameras.
Excellent phone!! Great price!!
"Nice buy in big billion day. Just finding it different to shift from Android to IOS not difficult. Nice camera, performance and battery."

"I have been using this iphone for more than an month and i must say it is worth the money. It has a good battery as compared to other iphone versions, but obviously not as good as android. But the security feature is top notch. Totally satisfied with the buy. Thank you flipkart fr the amazing offers"
Super year 2022
Superb phone
"Though i am using Google pixels 6 along with this iphone 13, trust me guys the camera quality of Google pixel is far better even my sister's samsung galaxy s21 camera has more features with great image quality. Iphone is just a hype ans showoff materials. But yes it's performance, ram management, and most importantly privacy & security is appreciating."

Every thing is good.But price little bit high.Camera goodBattery backup good almost 1 and 1/2 dayDisplay good but still ugly notch on top in 2022.Performance good.
"This is my first Iphone and I'm really glad that I decided to buy this. Everything about this phone looks so premium, battery backup is awesome, camera is top notch far better than any other Android phone available in the market. Thanks to seller and flipkart for quick delivery of this premium phone."
"Upgraded from iPhone 7 to 13 so feel like it's an upgrade. But if you own anything above XR or a XR it will surely feel almost the same, is my opinion."
Amazing experience Must buy
Everything is best but battery is terrible
"Upgraded from SE(2020),, 5 more years to go with this too"
For this price at least -display should be 120 hz
Excellent battery condition
GOOD PHONE WITH battery backup and smart camera
Looks good till now
The battery gets heated after using for one hour
Good
"5.7 inch would be sweet spot , 6 inch got extra spaces in screen"
"Let us ask ourselves, whether we need a show off phone or a trueblue utility device. If you opt for the latter, then 16e is for you. This is an absolute marvel with a minimalistic presence. Love it or hate it, this is an Apple product for India."
Awesome mobile
"Excellent phone at an affordable price. Got a great exchange deal for my Iphone11 and the extra discount for the card. The phone is top notch in terms of performance and feel and off course the battery back up, camera and audio quality pepping it nicely,  Thank you Flipkart for a great deal!!!"

"Bought the phone solely for battery performance and assuming camera of iPhones are always good. A bit of disappointment as I switched from Samsung S22 Plus which offered great screen quality, excellent camera and Galaxy AI did wonders while iPhone 16 is not performing as expected in terms of battery and camera quality.Pros:1. Touch screen2. Build Quality3. Light weightCons1. No major cons only thing is you will feel disappointed for few days as you switch from android to iOS more i...READ MORE"
"Upgraded to the 16 from my 12 and it is a great phone. The Ultramarine Blue looks and feels sooo good. The photos don't do enough justice to this variant.You definitely do not need to upgrade to this if you are having a 14 or a 15, unless Apple Intelligence is something that you do not want to live without.Camera is great, though not very sure of the Camera Control thing, cuz all that is pretty much available on-screen UI.Also, got a great deal on the exchange and bank offer, so zero co...READ MORE"
"Great Deal and Bank offer on Flipkart.Camera is excellent but observed heating issue while transferring data and while charging. I used to get same overheating issue in my Iphone 11, heating issue is same as my 4 year old iphone 11. Will post another review after a week of usage."
Battery Life is an issue other than that best phone to buy.

"Product is good but as you guys are already aware, I phone is just a show off thing. If you really wants features go for samsung"
iPhone 16 is best for those who not buy 15 series. And it has very best hand feel.
Wonderfully lightweight stuff. Worth purchasing. Improved speakers and a more seamless display. Incredibly cozy to use with one hand. Go for Teal colour.
Love it
Fell in love with the colour
Awesome product Battery Camera Body
Colour is very good also camera placement
"Worth purchase, good display and camera, battery can last almost a day on moderate usage without gaming, amazing sound quality.overall a perfect compact phone."

Best for videography and also good for photos if you are interested in little bit editing .Look and feel of the phone is premium and top notch software experience .Battery backup is good considering the form factor and performance is also superb .Major problem is low refresh rate but I tink those who are going to buy they know it already .Apple intelligence is till now under beta and some bugs are there which will be rectified by apple in updatesOverall a good buy if videography is a pr...READ MORE
Flipkart shopping experience was good from all time and This time also .Product was totally Original and Sealed Pack with all Accessories included on Box.

Nice
Its a fake detailsI haven't ordered Any Phone yetBut showing I phone jad ordered from I'd and it's Already deliveredRequest to Ekart to look in to thisIts Wrong things it should check on priority
Great iphone !
"This is Apple  The best quality delivered always. When I was installing my backup from my iPad, it became very hot during camera operation. But after the software update, gradually it became normal.Now it is working well. I also went to Imagine for a checkup and came to know that this is quite normal.That's it. I hope after the Apple intelligence update we can have some new features and entertainment windows will open for us  Thanks, FLIPKART, for delivering with promise and safety."
Upgrading from 12 mini. Awesome product. As usual performance is smooth for normal usage. Battery life is also good considering this form factor. Only downside is Apple Intelligence is not available out of the box. Camera quality is awesome.
I like this phone but there is no difference between 15 and 16 and apple Intelligence is also not in phone yet. Overall the phone is good but apple can do better
iPhone 16 has good quality camera and performance super bbb
Awesome  Protect  loved lt.
Excellent
"Compact, easy to carry. Like it"

"Loved it. Apple lasts longer, may for a min period of 10 yrs. The replacement of android phones in the same period easily exceeds the high initial cost of an iPhone ."
Camera 10/10Battery 10/8Display 10/10Design 10/10Performance 10/10Finally a Great Phone in this price segment
"I have switched from Pixel 6a to iPhone 16 , everything is good but camera is no match to pixel, even with 12 megapixel camera pixel 6a was much better."
Bad camera quality at this range. Go for samsumg s25
The best compact phone at the perfect 6.1 size. Only issue is with the outdated 60Hz display and a slower charging speed. Can't complain as it is cheaper than even the Pixel 9!
Recently changed from Android to Iphone seems a smooth ui and best experience
All good
BEST
Camera is superb
Great Product received via Flipkart.Everything is perfect about this phone except battery backup.I think need to work on battery.
My first iPhone and it's literally amazing although I like its performance and camera my overall experience is very good!
Classy.. different from Android but it is good to change for something different.
"iphone is ever good product to buy, but need to improve battery backup also.I think there is no need of camera short cut button, but it's good to open in single click, apple intelligence is ok ok feature.Is recommendable product you can buy."
Good
Good mobile
"I have been an Android user for 10 years, so I got the iPhone 16 as a secondary phone. It does the job, but honestly, nothing beats the freedom of an Android. It's like buying a fancy paperweight."
No doubt its built quality is unmatched. But Its better to buy an android phone of this range than this one. Android respects your freedom to choose more.
More smoothly then 15
"Amazing device, everything is top notch"
Upgraded from iPhone 14 Pro Max loved the new pink colour over all a wonderful product simply loved it
Switched from 12 mini to iPhone 16- battery 10/10- camera 10/10- hold and feel 10/10- ios 9/10- heavy tasking 8/10Should you upgrade?? If you are at iPhone 12/13 then you should   . From 14/15 you will minor improvement changes only !
Very nice
"Shifted first time from Android to ios. No regret at all.Minblowing experience, top notch performance, brilliant camera and super duper hit picture quality. Some people argue about battery drainage but in my case the battery goes up to 18 hours of normal usage.At first, you will feel awkward in iOS but later on it give you a better experience. And after all the security for which I shifted from Android to iOS.I am very happy with my brand new iPhone 16."
Fabulous.Apple intelligence is just wow!!
The mobile was Nice and  camera was good and clarity was excellent extra button was given was not so impressive the design of the mobile was also good
Wonderfully lightweight stuff. Worth purchasing. Improved speakers and a more seamless display. Incredibly cozy to use with one hand.
"I had previously used OnePlus 8 pro  ,Samsung s21 ultra, Vivo x80 pro soif you are confused between iphone 16 vs android alternatives like oneplus 13 or samsung s24i would say if your priorties are camera go for iphone 16 i know there is lack of telephoto lens but the main camera is just too good and UW lens got a good upgrade with macro support.Display brightness and colours are good but I miss 120hz but it's ui is quite fluid so okk okkBattery is good for size and charging speed are �...READ MORE"

"Great camera, great performance (although u might see a faster battery drain while playing heavy games like BGMI, GENSHIN) and it provides a complete lag free experience and the battery back up is too good as per its capacity. The charging is decent for a 20w charger. Smooth and clean UI experience! , Dynamic island features have been improved and it provides more informative features over there.

"I bought iphone 16, after 2 weeks giving the review. Camera too good, performance good, battery need to be improve."
"Best camera, performance also display, camera button also very useful, i wish battery could have been better in terms of battery backup."
Mind blowing
Very handy phone perfect in every aspect ..
It's very nice that I have upgraded my iphone 13 to an iPhone 16
I upgraded it from iphone 13 to iphone 16. Superbbbb experience
"It's a great peppy comfortable phone that Apple has released, just having a small heat issue which is acceptable. But I'm not satisfied with your exchange policy which I can't accept the way you've dealt with me! Otherwise phone is good! But I'm not satisfied with the exchange policy!"
Vary nice camera
Good

"Upgraded from iPhone 13. As expected, everything is just perfect for my kind of user who spends majority of time with this little beast. Apple never disappoints..  Proud owner of this gem for at least next 2 years before the next upgrade.."
"I'm a college student and I bought it with my scholarship money, I think the 16 base varient is a absolute beast for Photography and videography,  it's performance is also good no major heating issues and battery is overall good"
"Bought the iPhone 16 from Flipkart and it's amazing! The display is stunning, much better than other 60 hz models. Performance is smooth, the camera captures great photos, and the battery lasts all day. The Ultramarine color is beautiful and the design is sleek. Highly recommended!"
One of the best phone
"Phone is very smooth, battery is far better than 14 which I previously had. IOS 18 is perfectly running with no bugs"
"Awesome Phone. First iPhone bought. Comparing it with my S23 Ultra. Just trying to assess that iPhone and apple ecosystem is for me or not.All in all , Quite good till now with some minor bugs."
Nice mobile good looking
Literally i swear best smooth phone and camera is  and performance best multitasking phone
Apple intelligence is a scam. They advertised this phone especially for that and had a lot of us buy this on the promise and yet the apple intelligence is still not coming to india until next year.  This is just a waste of money.
Go and get it
"Photos Quality is Supreme,Display is Awesome,Performance is outstanding,But.Battery is worst,Display size is very Less"
"Amazing oneJust go for itCamera, battery, display,in hand feel , colour and the super fast processor is top notch"

The phone is good. It would take time to adopt with ios as i am switching from Android. Let's see how it goes.
Heating very frequently
"GREAT PRODUCT,  but now  This time is for ANDROID  , I Miss AI features in this mobile , boaring device , Google photos AI editing is wonder . But I disappointed with this iphone,  samsung is far better for now,  new lots of features. Bro don't buy if u need comfortable, something,  I buy only for flex I have both samsung and iphone , I love samsung S series"
Compact and good performance
"Best phone at best price...You can literally feel the oled touch.. Very smooth.. We don't  feel like 60hz refresh rate..Next is camera, it's  too good iphone nevrr dissopointmented with camera..Lite in weight..little slippery you must need a mil grade protection (though it's added weight worth having it)..More only apple intelligence for imessage and other stuff if very good and quite responsive..The siri is improved very much...Over all a best buy"
First time user for my daughter. Very nice experience. Worth to buy it under premium product category.There is something different which can be felt and could not be shared .
Value for money
GoodCamera and quality go for it
Everything is fantastic go for it

"60 hz display is not worth it for an iPhone 16, that needs a more refresh rate."

Everything is fine except the battery should have been lasting longer and the new camera buttonFelt useless
This 16 series is a surprise. I had been using 13 and found a little nudges with it when it comes to performance and the battery section. With the 16 apple has significantly improved in these sections. Battery is amazing I have been using the device for my media play primarily and it is giving me backup of more than half a day with continuous video playback watching movies surfing social media. It is better than my other mobile samsung s23. The camera as usual is good and the phone doesn't la...READ MORE

The display is absolutely crazy and also I can say that the haptics of the phone is super smooth but only concerned is that image editing ai is not good as Samsung
Terrific
Its good one. Security matters most. IOS seems to be secure than Android
"Just waaaaooo!! Have upragded from ipnone 12. Previous month, i have exchanged my iphone 12 for google pixel 9. Bt my expectations were high, unfortunately was missing my smooth and fast ios which can never be replaced. This month i have purchased iphone 16..guys and girls, never think twice before buying any iphone if your pockets allows you to do so."

After 10 days phone start heating .while connected with Apple store .They said camera is faulty.It seems Flipkart selling defective iphones.Terible product.After buying 70k .Neither Apple store not flipkart returning .All are theifs in India
I sifted from android 90 (hz rr )to iphoneSo performance is far better than any androidCons - while charging u will get heatingAnd battery will last a day with normal useSot aprox 7. 30 hrs without any heavy appsPhotos and especially photography mode i like it
Phone received in good quality. Bought it in great price in sale. The delivery was delayed. Simply best just go for it if you are iphone fan. I was thinking to buy 16e but it's just like iPhone X . Instead  for 16.Not used to the new side camera button. Let's see.
Its awasm experience to return back after 10 year to iphone
Go for  15 ya 16 pro
just one word. Stunning
Best under budget phone
Great upgrade!Camera is much improved. Dynamic Island is now very useful. No apple intelligence till now. Otherwise experience is great.
iPhone 16 battery is awesome
Finally from android to iOS
Best ever experience this is my first iphone black colour is so premium tnks to my sister
"Phone is Good.But according to me it's overhyped.Camera is Good,but as per the Price I think iphone can do better than this.pink Color is Good.No heating issues.Display is Clear and Bright.almost Bezel less design."
Fantastic
Damn good
Great deal
I am using iPhone since 2020 and this my biggest upgrade xr to iPhone 16 I love the colour. I love the performance. No issues at all so
Good
Phone is good but refresh rate is less over all good phone
Good
"My first ever Iphone and I am really happy with the purchase. If anybody is looking for a change from Android to IOS then this is it. Display is good, battery life is good. Camera is amazing."
Perfect phone but design is not up to the mark (iPhone 15 have better design compare to iPhone 16) otherwise great
"Have been using this for 6 months. Was my first iphone, after using S Series. probably not switching back to android.Best features- Size, Design. Apple ecosystem, intuitive interface, subtle elements of ML in audio control, battery enhancement, automation etc.Downside- Missing the zooming capability of Samsung, connecting over weak wifi is troublesome, less storage."
Amazing camera
"Average camera, Pictures from my Nothing phone is far better than this over hyped product.No value for money only show off.I would recommend going for a pixel phone for this price range rather than this iphone."
Brought iPhone 16 was excited as the reputation of brand and the feeling of buying a new iPhone but this phone disappointed me as there was Overheating problem can be seen in minimal
It heats like a pan in 2 mins of use
Camera is pretty lagging when we want to take sudden photos. Photo quality has improved. 24 mp default gives more detail. Apple giving still 60Hz display is a let down. Battery life is mediocre and it heats quickly. An overall downgrade from iphone 14
Camera is good in only video. Photos are wrost
Overall value for money
Product is awesome
Good
It good for 3 days I will watch one year than review
iPhone 16 is the best quality and camera quality is best in best
I am not satisfied I am a big fan oneplus mobile phone

Just like a Wow.
Just love my first Iphone.
Camera performance is very poor and bettery is very disgusting apart from this performance is very slow and phone is heating very bad .Also the delivery partner charged me 1400 extra by cash .
Within one week voice is not coming while I am callingFake product

"Perfect phone with this price limit, worth for every penny, thanks to FLIPKART"
Good phone
"Amazing iphone 16 ,feeling like smooth and fresh"
Nice
Feels good to have good phone on hand
"The iPhone 16 is a game-changer! Apple has taken things to the next level with a stunning larger display, incredibly smooth performance powered by the A18 chip, and next-gen AI features that truly feel futuristic."
Amezing phone..
Good
Motherboard got damaged in one week
Awesome
Such a great and powerful phone
The third one from the apple family and I am totally satisfied with the product ...Absolute bonkers gaming performance the screen size is a bit of an issue for me as it is too small and to handle that I already had a iPhone 15 plus and the in hand feel the overall quality of the product is top notch
"I Love This iPhone Teal ColourCamera Is GoodPerformance Is GoodBattery Is Also Good As Compare To Previous VersionDesign Is Lovely, In-hand Feel Premium"

I love  this phone. I like it is performance so smooth to touch and play. Awesome  for me.Love its camera and other features.My only question about this phone is that if all the iPhones record too much noise while recording videos???? There is too much noise heard after recording.

The camera quality is top-notch, capturing sharp and vibrant photos even in low light. iOS runs smoothly, and the design feels premium and comfortable in hand.

"Phone is excellent no doubt . However, be sure about exchange price of phone if any .. As seller has some software which assess your good phone to an average phone . So be mindful on exchange. If your phone is in good condition better not to exchange on lower price"
Giving electric shock while charging. Total disappoinment even after spending 80k for this phone.
Runs smoothly.

Mobile is very handy. Packed with good performances and nice camera. This is my first iPhone. Very good experience with Apple. Battery is worst. I am hardly getting 5 hours screen on time.  Positive thing is I came to know how many hours I was spending on my mobile. Because of poor battery now I am only using mobile for 4 hours a day.

Amazing phone with beast performance and super value for money if you wanna be in apple eco system this is great device for you.

Best camera phoneImage processing is bestBest display and battery life is also bestBest processorOverall best phoneU can look after images also
"Greatest phone for who looks for power in a compact form! Camera is outstanding, Check the samples."
"If you are going to use apple for first time then you will be amazed. Performance wise this phone is ultra first. Camera is also pretty good, attached images were taken indoor only. Display is also quite good.The BEST thing about this phone is it’s size. So easy to use this phone singe handedly. Excellent grip. Fits very crisply in pockets.The worst thing is it’s battery. Doesn’t last long. Better to have a power bank to avoid sudden switch off."
Handy sizeStunning performanceOutstanding camera quality
"People talk about it’s battery backup?? man I’m in love with this handset. So clean, so smooth. Smoother than xr if you’ve used both you’ll understand. Camera better than xr. Battery of xr is better but still I’ll vote for se because of A13 Bionic chip, touch haptics and many more reasons. Its a beast in this segment. Still I want you all to feel this beast in your hand. Sexy as it looks, just a perfect masterpiece."
"Keep the battery aside and I don’t see any other reason why you shouldn’t buy it. It’s super fast, has an awesome pair of camera, punchy speaker, good looks, beautiful screen, perfect size and an amazing user experience. Everything about this phone is no nonsense.Coming to battery, I was aware it was less but I didn’t care because for my casual usage, it easily lasts 24hours. It easily gives an onscreen time of 4 hours per day and if you are using your phone for more than that, you know you...READ MORE"
"Camera is best. Mobile performance is good. 4.7 inch display phone is handy phone. Battery capacity is not good but in this range phone is good . Dual sim phone and one sim slot supported eSim. Better series in iPhone is X ,XS ,XR and 11. Software iOS 14.3 is latest."
Nice product Osm look

Canara quality is goodPerformance is awesomeExcellent for gaming but small screenAnd battery performance is not much goodTotally product is nice I loved it
Amazing camera super iphone se
Full of exciting features
It is a very good device. You will feel how premium is it whenever you hold in your hand. It is very nice to hold. And size is just perfect! Above all it has the best camera. See the attached picture which I clicked in the evening.You should go for the red one!
"Been using it for almost a year now. I switched to this phone from Samsung galaxy a50 and it was really hard getting used to a 4.7 inch screen from a 6.4 inch one. However, with time i got used to the display and it feels just like any standard display. The display panel is 750p which would look blurry if the screen of this phone was bigger. As it has a smaller screen the pixels are packed close to each other which results in a sharp looking display. Coming to the battery life of this phone, ...READ MORE"

"Good for normal use like browsing and not recommended for gaming because of small screen size,overall a good product from apple."
"Wanna small,handy, cute phone ? Just go for it. Not for gamer's, but for simple usage and premium class phone."
I love the camera quality it very good
"Very nice phone. Actually it's my first iPhone so I was very excited. Nd I'm happy with this phone.Nice phone for gaming, battery backup is not that much for gaming but I suggest buy one good powerbank or fast charger. If u have small fingers then it's best device for u."
Best in the world
Good one
"One word.. beautiful iphone  premium feelJust go for it without any doubt. Superb camera, handy, white color is soo good.This phone is for someone who don't like big screen phones."
"Hey iPhone lovers. If you like small phone you'll love it. A13 performed like a beast. Performance is top notch. If your budget tight, then go for it. You never disappoint after use it. And Apple iPhone security is best."
"My first iPhone and very happy with it. Slick and gorgeous design with perfect compact mobile. Performance is so amazing ,display softness more than 5 *. Little bit battery issues for fast drains like need to charge once in a 12 hours. May be this will solve out in next update. Definitely worth to buy than other brands."
Good product as expected.
"What a great buy. I'm so glad I didn't fall for bad battery reviews by some teenagers. If you don't play games then this phone can last you 5-6 hours SOT!For me its giving me 5 hours SOT with lots of whatsapp, spotify, twitch and youtube.If you got a 9 to 5 job and don't play games then this is the phone for you!"
"Let's face it. The main reason you're even considering this is because you want a compact phone that doesn't compromise on power. Getting OS updates for another 4-5 years, with a decent camera, waterproofing and wireless charging is just an added advantage.There's a few things it could've done better:1. Battery is barely adequate for a day of moderate usage.2. The bezels could have been reduced to have more screen to body ratio.3. Night mode for the camera was a software feature that ...READ MORE"
Nice Product. Best camera ever.
It’s completely perfect phone for me thank you Flipkart and apple.
Perfect in size and performance And nothing can beat iPhone’s camera
Awesome camera phone
Excellent phone from Apple... Almost same like iPhone 7 and 8 with latest processor. I can feel the speed very much compared to the iPhone 6s. It’s awesome budget phone from iPhone family.
Got in good price in big billion day. Overall performance is good but battery backup is not satisfied.

"One word, Outstanding!I’ve Samsung galaxy A70 and I turned off many of its services including animations so that it give me a all day battery life but this is not the case with this iPhone SE .It comes with just 1821 mah battery but trust me It gives 24hr battery backup which includes 4.5hr on screen time.Mostly I use my phone for WhatsApp, insta, news articles, YouTube music and puzzle games when I got time.It’s display is good, looks like OLED one (but it is not)."

"This is my first iPhone. I would say that coming from Android, there are some times when I feel that it is restricted in certain ways and you just have to accept it.Coming to the phone itself, camera is amazing minus the low light photography part. Battery backup is ok ok. I bought 12W Apple charger separately which charges it pretty fast so I do not worry about battery being low. Also since I am mostly at home, it doesn’t matter so much. Display is ok. Its a nice display but a small one a...READ MORE"

So far it’s good. Camera and performance is very nice. Was little disappointed with battery luckily govt did lockdown again now i have full day to charge
Charging point issue. Phone is not getting charged so I had to go service centre. Disapointed.
While the performance you get from this small phone is great if I were to choose again I would be looking at an android phone just because of battery life I get from this phone.
My ¹st iphoneAm so happyBut request plz give a adapter with this phone
Gud
Good product
"This Phone is Simply Brilliant.The fastest mobile processor from Apple, A13 bionic chip can tackle any task without breaking a sweat. The CLASSIC Design is the reason to buy this phone as it is so easy for one hand operation. Camera performance and Battery backup has been improved significantly over the predecessor. Definetely a Value for your Buck."
"ProsClassy performance , sensitive touch , good sound quality , beautiful design , compact and comfortable,Good quality Camera, Battery backup is normal.ConsPhone is overheating this is something not expected from APPLE Bit disappointing.Selfi photo click flips automatically so sometimes photos are weird. Wish there is a setting not to flip before foto click."
"Good phone for basic use(chatting, calling, clicking few photos)Battery drains quickly on heavy use(watching videos or gaming)Got the 128gb version for 40k after applying offers so I felt it was worth it.Why to spend 30k on oppo,vivo etc"
The delivery speed is amazing I booked at 7 pm and the next morning by 9am I got the productReally fast delivery
"Best iPhone in this price range.It can do almost everything an iPhone 11 can do and will get long support for iOS updates.Battery life is very good very few people know how to optimise the iOS according to their needs for battery usage. So I get easily a day of use, many people say heavy usage consumes battery life that's true for any smartphone even iPhone 11."
Need to buy charger and EarPods separately
I was waiting for the device for too long time. Finally got it and it feels GOOOOD... Although the battery life isn't too much but still i loved the model...Performance : AwseomeCamera : GoodBattery : Average
"Awesome product. Handy to use, white colour is superb."
Worst battery
The model i got is Assembled in INDIA which do-not have charger brick & EarPods The box only contains THE PHONE & THE CHARGING CABLE AND THE PAPER GUIDS WITH ONE APPLE STICKER100% The phone is value for the money
The only drawback is battery backupElse it’s iPhone everyone dreams of it. Great performance one handed use and the slick and slim design
Safe delivery thanks to flipkart
Loved the look
Phone is good if ypu wish t ahift drom android and want a decent camera in your pocket. Defenetly not for gamers because processor Bionic A13 can take nay game with full graphics no prob but battery will disappoint you. Not for long video calls rest things are fine premium feel full display could have been better.If battery and display is also important ro you consider XR or 11.
Its an apple go and grab it. You wont regret.
"Will keep it short:Pros:Awesome cameraGreat speakersBlistering performance benchmarksThe Size (had been long waiting for this one)Cons:Decent display (not really a con)Not that great battery life, but after optimising a lot of settings, with moderate usage it lasts almost for a day. For a power user, probably half a day.Overall, a great bang for buck, undoubtedly."
"This has been one of the best variant including features that are a mixture of the other variants of  iPhone. This 5 rating is just for the phone.The only problem I had was the delivery of the product. I received my product after 15 days, so a lot disappointed from Flipkart services and their team.

I got this model on Flipcart Dussehra sale I bought it only at 29595. So on that price the  product is literally good/ awesome. But one or two things which I am disappointed with this phone are the display size which is very less than usually I like. And second one  is it's selfie camera quality which was very good in my previous phone (OPPO).
Its a gift for my  wife and i haven't given it to her yet....but the phone was in awesome package and it looks superb....my wife is an apple user..and m sure she will love it.
Very nice phone because of its size...camera is awsome.Bit disappointed of its battery.Performence is awsome and style is fabulous.Premium feel is there.Bazel could have been possibly removed for more screen size.Ita my first iphone and am quite satisfied about it.

Very good phone very convenient to use due to it’s size. Display is no problem if you can connect to iPad via hotspot and enjoy watching videos and reading articles. Even playing games on my mini iPad.Battery performance could have been better as people are dependent on their phones to a great extent for their daily activities. So if you use the phone except for heavy gaming it should get you thru the day easily.So why should you choose it: well it’s an iPhone and It’s fantastic performance...READ MORE

Amazing phone with superb Performance.
I just bought this phone because of its slimness .... Are u also here just to buy it because of its slim body and extreme features then like this review and purchase it
"Best iPhone for this price…as it is small device definitely it has average battery life but u will love it , because of performance and camera"
Nice and sleek.. biggest motivator is the a13 bionic chip
Value for money .....little worry for the battery backup quite low as per my opinion. Bt no compromise on othe features by company. Great camera..performance it good(A13 bionic chip)
I am ISO user since last 5 years and upgraded with iPhone 5s>iPhone 6s>iPhone SE. I am highly satisfied with the product and features. Chip 13 gives me amazing results and experience. Battery is not an issue for me. I like the size 4.7 the most. I am happy with my product so far. Thank you Apple and Flipkart.Suggest to sell iPhones assembled in India to support Aatmanirbharbharat mission.
I am using since october 2020 and no issues till now.... superb product with this price. i bought it for Rs 25000
Everything is good but only battery issue ..!! If your playing game ..!! If ur Norma user no problem u can enjoy ..
Camera quality is really good.
"Phone has a very good build quality, performance is pretty good. Camera is pretty decent, battery backup is however not up to the mark given the fact that it has a 1821 mAH battery."
Best phone just loved it...Drawbacks which i faced but not a big problm are face-lock should be include if they put all in small package so y ths not and battery power too small.
"If you are not into playing games on mobile and want to enter into apple environment, this is the best phone. Great camera, battery lasting for a day, and of course feel of IOS.On time delivery from Flipkart."

I was an android user in the past decade. Thought of switching to iPhone. The experience that you get is premium and classy. Go for it. Battery backup is great for a 1820mAH battery.

"People who love the older style with home button should definitely go for this, we rather get the same processor for a lower range compared to iphone 11If camera / better battery life / bigger screen is your priority then you get iphone 11."
Very nice smooth finish ... long wait really love the phone
Beyond expectations
Bad battery
"Am not of a Iphone user being this my first Iphone, and earlier I have used Motorola one Power, Redmi 3S Prime and some of the battery efficient android phones, charge doesn’t t last much. Iphone has it’s name over battery inefficiency, so can be ignored. And since I had a screen size specific requirement, I have no regrets. Shifting from Android to IOS, is a bit messy. Overall performance of the phone is decent. I feel I paid hefty for the brand image of Apple."
Got it for 25999/-. Value for the money. 4K 60 fps Video is awesome.
Very bad battery life
battery is not get fully charged & cell getting  too hitting too much as per value its not worth to have I phone SE 202O
"One of the best handsets, very easy to carry & handle. Exceptional performance & amazing display, however battery is the only concern. It consumes more battery when you use internet, especially streaming videos and also while taking pictures. Otherwise everything thing is perfect. People who don’t like to carry big handsets on pocket can definitely go for this. But remember if you play more games or if u r always on internet you might need to carry a fast charger."
Awesome product nice packaging thanks to flipkart & Apple..
Thanks Flipkart..
Small is screen size. Better to go for bigger screen size probably XR or 11.
"The phone is awesome, I gave the 2 star for the phone and I hate the delivery. It took more than 20+ days to deliver."
Best value for money!! I got this iphone just 26000
"Performance good, Battery stand by low, Over heat while charging or using even bit high, Camera good, Sound quality good, Awesome headset, great and simple design."
I would not recommend this one as I have used iPhone 6 and 7 both before purchasing this one but really not felt the kind of performance 6 or 7 has. This one is way beyond.
Very good
I purchased this product for 22K so I’m fortunate to get it as less as possibleProduct is GoodOf course Battery isn’t doing wellBut Performance is pretty good
"For the price of 30k, this is one good phone.For normal users and non gamers ,Camera is better than most of android phones under 50kPerformance is top notch.Battery could be better, though it gave me more than 8 9 hours with normal web surf and netflix here and there.Not for gamers. Easy battery drain within 3 hours if you play any game.I personally don’t care abt size pf the phone but with bigger hands, its small. If you like smaller and compact phone, this one’s for u."
The phone is smooth worth buying
"It's Very light Use.. Just Make Call, Whatsapp, and Normally YouTube Watch...Don't Expect Whole Days Battery Backup"
Amazing phone with good camera for a great deal. And it’s super fast and very good feel and quality.
After one month of using I can say it’s perfect for students battery is sufficient and it’s not for gaming
"good product , baterry low , charge 2 times in a day , camera gd, speed also well"
I would just say its just osm with fastest processorOnly not for gammers as battey drains if u wanna play games pub g etc.. other wise its very nice
One the most beautiful phone .i loved it

If you are looking for a switch from android to iOS then iPhone se is the best option at this price range. Performance is excellent - thanks to the A13 bionic chipset.

"I you were using full-display earlier, this would look outdated, the problem with smaller screen is the typing. With smaller screen you wan't get enough are to type, and bezels looks pretty bad."
Battery backup is a bit less as compared to earlier variants that I have used but still not a big problem. Got the 128 GB phone around 28k and definitely is value for money.

its very small to utilize and some times the touch is not working properly

The phone sent without charger this is horrible experience.first of all Iphone needs specific charger that itself is missing. Display is very small not value for money.
"A perfect blend of nostalgia, perfect size and ergonomics combined with super top of the line specs but with some back dates stuff !Overall, a value for money Apple phone which will last you another 3-4 years, maybe more and will never let you down.Battery is a bit on the weaker side but with a 100% charge it will last you a bit more than a full day with normal to regular usage ( including phone calls,video calls, Youtube, OTT platforms, Social Networking sites and Camera. )Games play smo...READ MORE"
Super phone
"Received in 2 days! Excellent delivery by Flipkart! About the phone, needless to say it is an Apple. I rest my case there."
Great
Waste
Worth for money but battery back up is little less compared to other mobile of iPhone
"The phone is very fast and good for an average user. My only problem with this is the charger that came in the box. It feels very flimsy and plasticky compared to the smooth and premium feeling that the phone gives. I also wish the camera had portrait mode for objects too. But, overall excellent value for money!"
bettery performance very poor don't go for it please 4 time charge in a day
Phone is exceptionally good. Latest iphone software makes it more rewarding with latest features. Worth buying
High performance and speed. Good camera too. Battery back up is pathetic. Full battery Lasts upto 3-4 hours only.
Very nice phone
I have using iPhone XR except of the screen sizeEvery thing is great about this phone se 2020Speak about battery it’s far better compare to iPhone 8The new processor is helping a lot  and fast enoughSmall in size
Very Bad
"This is the best budget smartphone for playing pubg. I basically bought it for playing pubg. Altough the battery is not good, all you need to do is play the game while charging so that no battery problem will occur."
"My expectations for a mobile phone were simple: 1) Need to have good call clarity 2) Should be handy 3) Good enough camera quality to capture memories 4) The battery should last at least 2 days.In this quest, the best fit i found was Redmi 2 Prime mobile, it had all things matching. Later the mobile boom was phenomenal that all the points except Point ""2) Should be handy"" were met. The screen size of phones have increased manifold. My quest for handy had very few models if brand is also a c...READ MORE"
Already an avid apple family user. Wanted to replace my wife's aging iPhone 5S. This was the best alternative that I could find in 2020. One of the best hardware at awesome price.
Okk ok
Not satisfied with battery backup but overall it's a great phone.
Great value on big billion day nice product.and I got it for 28k
I loved the size of phone!!
"Overall iphone se is really good. Camera, performance are top-notch among budget phones. Battery life is ok but not up to the mark. May be an iphone battery case will fix the battery issue if you want to use this iphone specifically."
"The phone have best camera, best performance but its battery made me sad."
Good
Good
"Awesome, I was using  iPhone XR which is large and bulky this one is compact and really fits into the hand,  with all the functions of XR iphone. Battery  life is the only problem. if you're heavy user watching lots of videos and playing games better don't go for it."
Battery backup as usual worst..Camera is not so good as you spending 40ks to 60 ks it should be multi lense camera...Display is not bright enough...Only plus point is does not lag ...though I am sure it will start doing that after few updates..
Awesome IPhone Se2020
Awesome
"A good phone for ladies according to the size. Compact and handy with a lot of powerful features.Best camera, classic look, powerful processor and of course an Apple product which is a style statement.Battery is very good. Efficient for 1 day usage. Don't go with the negative reviews, just experience the iPhone. Worth it."
"Fantastic phone, in a beautiful form factor, handy, ergonomic and power packed device. Please do not go by the reviews of ""PUBG chipmunks"", who are looking for a device for gaming purposes. This is the perfect phone for no non sense every day users, who would like to make calls,browse the internet, use mail clients and do social networking."
Worth for money
"I have been using the iPhone se 2020 for close to a week now and I am super happy with the experience. As you might have seen in multiple reviews of the device, the battery life is a setback. But the battery easily lasts for a day with a good amount of gaming and video streaming and that works for a user like me."
"This is not full review, but on the basis of my usage I have to admit for sure this is the best phone in terms of gaming.. Only little bit problem is the battery.. I hope this will help.."
A great deal on BBDlv u Flipkart
Battery life is not good very bad experience
Just as you expect in an apple product. Disappointed with camera performance but the rest of features are great. So try the phone in hand before you decide to buy as it is indeed a small screen and you have to have a liking for such phones before you buy
It's been a month now and I'm writing my review about this iphone. So it was my first experience to buy a phone online that too iPhone and I was already prepared about the phone (cons i.e display and battery). So keeping those two things aside it's really good I personally liked it and I was buying this phone because of the iOS camera and I'm very much satisfied with the camera quality and video quality. And if you can ignore those two things which is battery and display then only you can get...READ MORE
Good design feels good in hand performance is great only battery is small but it managing well somehow I need to charge it in the end of the day according to my usage. And hope Apple would upgrade night mode camera in this device in upcoming update. I Don't have any issue with screen size although it depends on the personal preferences. I prefer compact phones
Performance and quality of the phone is really good.
Good product and on time delivery
Overall it is good but only drawback is the battery to be charged everyday
"No games installed, just with normal usage as well battery drains fast. Won't last for a day per full charge. Everything else is top notch."
Nice phone. Whole new experience but bettry is very low. It can be your 1st iPhone.
"Got it for 25000, A13 chip at this price point is extreme value for money. But there is no denying the fact that battery back up is poor as per current standards."
"Good one,handy and perfect upgrade for someone who upgrades from iphone 7 or 6 and wants something similar"
Thanks
Posting this review after 8 months & i must say this is the superb phone for those who want a compact phone..battery backup is decent for normal users.Camera is as usual more than fantastic.Just close Your eyes and hit the buy button.
I bought 26k. All are good except battery capacity :)
A great purchase
I got this beast at 24k around..superb performance
All are ok except battery. General use also not standing for a day. Wherever i go i need to take charger. Even going to office.
"If you ignore the battery, Apple has launched a excellent smartphone at this price."
Awesome
"Vfm device, excellent performance"
"Best, I always love apple"
Good phone and good battery life
Awsome camera awsome performance but battery could have been better
Thank you
I got this for my father. He is using it for few months. Battery is a problem. Need to charge every day. Performance is super.
I'm very excited for this product
Battery quality is not good
Value for money
Very good phone with extream gamingIts heat up and battery is not so goood
"Battery sucks, gets drained within 2 hours on heavy usage. Performance okay"
"In the box charger & headphones is missing.  Dont know why a brand like Apple do such kind of harasment with customers. Though I gave 4 stars rating only bcoz of the phones performance, camera , built quality and features which is outstanding. Moreover performance wise it is as strong as iphone 11 pro , as both of them have A13 bionic chipset which is amazing."
Using it for 7-8 days  satisfied by the phone
Unsatisfied very bad product
Screen vibrate while play songs but overall best one phone.
Super mobile
This is my first iPhoneAwesome performanceCamera is so nice
Very gd phone it lower ur mobile usage time by reducing unnecessary notifications from app and also true tone display do care of your eyes and small size phone and powerfull performance make it a epic choice

I can't express in words .means that mind-blowing amazing I love it
Products is good but Flipkart rate is high
Great One.Battery is Bit Low. But iPhone is always good camera quality is good and the performance is very very good I am loving it personally
"Hey,Got this on discount working very well and most importantly its genuine product  purchased electronic fisrt time from online store so.....Can trust now thats all."
As my requirements the phone is great at this price rangeFlipkart give us the best possible prices for apple device
Everything seems fine with this phone but this is a super fast car but with a small gas tank the one and only con of this phone but if you are looking to buy this phone you know what you have signed up for but if you want to get a scoop of ios for the first this will be a perfect device to start with as it comes with the one of the best processor at an reasonable price tag my suggestion is that if you can compromise by charging your phone for 2 times a day you can easily go for it
Why always poor battery apple.... an apple can energize full body... but it don't have battery i think they have taken it seriously....
Excellent performance. Non apple user can try this iOS user interface at low budget.
Compact & only for official works... Not for gamers
Very nice
Value for money
HiIt Is an great product but comparing to my old phone battery is draining quickly and also charging is slow but if you buy 15 V charger charging will become faster.
"Worst site worst products, don't bye any products in this site,"
It’s value for money
Battery screwed. There is some defect. The phone keeps shutting down and battery drops from 99 to 10 % in 2 hours
Highly recommended............Awesome camera quality.....Specially portrait mode.It’s worth buying it.Thanks Flipkart.
Mobile is heating while using camera.Battery is decent without gamingCamera is too goodBetter to go xr model
"This is one more power packed phone from apple. Camera and performance are up to the mark. Battery could have  been little better, however if you are not using your phone as a media device then still it holds good.Overall a good phone from apple family at this price."
"Best budget iphone you could buy, i really recommend to those who are Android users and doesn't want to spend much but still want to experience Iphone. Go for it. yeah people will say its battery is bad. If you are using it for long it definitly will not last long. But if you use it as secondary phone its a good chooice."
Best of Best
"Good Smartphone, will provide additional review post usage of 7 days."
"I just received my T4 Ultra, Outstanding performance in all areas especially the camera is first class in the segment but I guess the back panel is not glass material."

"The phone is so good in every aspect...camera is so good, portraits are amazing,super macro is very good...Only thing is battery u need to charge once a dayWill update after some days"

"I recently upgraded from the Oppo Reno 6 Pro to the new Reno 14, and I'm absolutely impressed! The design feels more premium, the display is stunning with vibrant colors and buttery-smooth refresh rate, and the camera performance is on another level especially in digital zoom and selfie. The battery life is excellent and charges super-fast with the new tech. Overall, it's a perfect upgrade in every way. Oppo nailed it again! Highly recommended for anyone looking for a flagship experience."
"Very beautiful phone, there is no phone in the world like this. The camera is very good."
Absolutely gorgeous phone. Cameras are super impressive. I've upgraded from Redmi K50i and the OS is so good. No issues with performance as well because the processor is super optimized. The battery will improve with usage as early days it will discharge a little faster. Didn't get any heating issue yet.Overall super satisfied and happy.

Camera quality is not upto the mark at this range. That's why i m giving only 3 star. Even a 24k realme 13 pro plus taking super portraits than oppo reno 14. Whole money goes to advertisement only. But usage experience is very good.
Very good phone.aal is well
What I liked most about Call Language is that it transfers voice calls in Hindi

"I am loving this phone, it's just few days since I got the device, I have lot more to explore. Good videography and photography phone in budget."
Best Product
"Overall, the phone is a decent device.  The display quality is truly impressive and a highlight of the user experience.  However, the haptic feedback feels somewhat lacking and could be more refined.  Low-light video performance is definitely an area needing improvement.  I hope to see these issues addressed in future updates."
"For this sale price now(may 2025), it is a really great dealPros -1. SUPER SMOOTH UI (especially One UI 7)although it is a exynos processor, it is a flagship exynos processor with slight underclock (definitely can handle gaming too but not competitive or serious gaming).2.

Very good and camera quality superb and gaming performance was excellent
"Great phone ... a little bit expensive at this price but in a few months it will be a better phone in which ever price segment it goes in, I had to buy it early because my last phone was almost dead . A great camera with night photography as the main camera is of a flagship grade , battery will last you max one and a half days with 6-7 hr screen time , good speaker and display also the best part is that it has 6-7 years of OS support"
Slightly overpriced but overall a good phone
"Video quality should be improvedCamera is niceHeating in outside but Quickly Cool downBattery Backup should be More according to 4700MAHMulti tasking is like Butter.UI EXPERIENCE IS LIKE professional software usingDesign is totally feeling like flagship mobile people ask for which mobile it's.This mobile is only for UI, MULTI TASKING, CAMERA AND OBVIOUSLY AI."
Grate phone
Excellent camera quality.Awesome display.Super sound.Premium look.Decent batteryI am not disappointed with the buy.I think it is better than iPhone
Phone is good but some functions don't work properly or may be I don't know how to use because it's my first smart phone
"Great camera phone, battery lasts for 1 day easily with normal usage and feels little bulky in hand as it is a large display phone."
"Best flagship phoneDisplay-10/10Camera -9/10Battery- 9/10Performance- 10/10Design- 10/10Overall the phone is very smooth to use,  Camera is excellent, battery last full day for most users, beast on performance.. No regrets for switching from iPhone.."
"It is a good phone.Mobile will get little warmer during charging.Camer is good, and portrait shots are very good."
"The Galaxy S24 FE offers a premium design, vibrant AMOLED display, solid performance with the Exynos 2400 chip, and reliable battery life. Cameras are good in daylight but average in low light but 4k 60fps video mode is so amazing. It includes long software support, but lacks fast charging and a charger in the box. A solid upper-midrange choice."
"Suitable for moderate use cases.  Minor heating is observed during multitasking, effectively managed by the device's cooling system.  Camera: Excellent (10/10). Design: Excellent (10/10). Performance: Strong (8.5/10)Recommended for all and you can trust on Samsung"
Loved it
Used 10days. Camera is good as expected.  Battery coming full day with mobile data also. Overall it's worth for 45k.
1. Great screen size.2. Stable processor3. Battery back up is awesome4. No heating issues5. Great speakersAI generative editing is quite fun to play while clicking images and the best one is it replaces the object quite easily eg if you click a pic with a hand in front of half your face and you remove the hand it will reconstruct your face  exactly it should be.So over all a good purchase in flip kart sale. With exchange of my pixel 7a I got it for 22k.Thanks flipkart.
"I'm extremely happy with this Samsung s24fe phone! I've been using it for a while now, and I'm thoroughly satisfied. No issues whatsoever, it works perfectly fine. The performance, camera, and battery life are all top-notch. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable phone. Five stars from me!"

MODERATE USE.CAMERA:IN THIS SEGMENT CAMERA
Working fine
S24fe after immesrive use of 5 months. I m writing my reviewCamera is best and design in slim and awesome and battery is good and holding for 2 dys. More over the phone is completely beautiful and tuff use is best in this budget
"Pls don't buy dis phoneDon't go for fake reviewsHeating issues,battery draining and no updates"
In one wordPerfection
Awesome
ALL GOOD THIS PRODUCT ONLY SOME FACE HEATING ISSUE
Best mobile in the market. Only issue is delivery not in time
It's been couple of days i have been using this product and it is truly a worth purchasing product.
"Heating issue, rest is OK"
"After two months use there are some issue finger print is very slow, heating issue is a very big problem"
There is a problem with the 5G network. Most of the time I am getting LTE but not 5G.
Best camera Constant 90 fps bgmiFlagship for every reason
Super  phone
Best camera and Best one uiNice
"Performance wise really very awesome. But Battery is not at all good. They need to improve more in that or we should buy power bank with in that. My previous phone Samsung M35, 1% charger equals to 3%."
"The product is best, no doubtBut facing some heating issues and battery backup should be increased"
"Everything is perfect only the battery is the down point beside all is great must purchase at this price loved it, worst delivery experience by flipkart and their third party delivery agent"
Amazing display and camera..Battery backup is Battery than previous fe series.It's become more loveable after Android 15 update
"Battery:Enough for one day use if you use for social media and calls. Gamers may have to charge twice a day.Display:Marvelous AMOLED Display and colours are stunning.Performance:Nice, not super cool but Enough to handle day to day tasks.Network:Connectivity is good Camera:The main feature where the phone rocks. Photos are crisp and clean. Video stability is good.Nice phone. Bought for 32K in summer offer. Worth every penny."
Evening is good except heating issue even without any heavy usage. Google Maps and one more task heats it a lot
Awesome product definitely go for it those who says battery dies quickly is a gimmick works like a normal android phone last a day easily
Really good to be back to SamsungWonder why did I left in the first placeOnly thing design and looks can be improved for sureHave a designer addition or something
Excellent phone ...top notch display ...no heating issue...only concern about battery.. battery lasting only 12 hrs with moderate use..need to charge twice a day.. camera performance is Excellent

Nice product but battery optimisation not goodSamsung company should solve battery  issue and long duration
The phone i purchased was of 35k and it was worth buying it. About phone performance you can get high performance phone in this budget. So if you are looking to play games so this device is not for u but if you are looking for camera phone but ios then this the best choice you could ever make

"As everyone mentions, the heating issue is there in this phone. It heats during normal usage and charging, and the battery is not good. I didn't find the camera so great.only design is good and ui experience is good .I am not satisfied with the phone, earlier I was using samsung A52, that was much better than this heater, we can use this phone to relieve the body pain by touching the heated phone on swollen or paining area."

"The camera is great, there are 4 camera lenses and all 4 of them take good pictures. The display is also good for its price range. And the design also gives a flagship look. But I did not like two things in this phone, the battery of the phone and if you use 5G internet for 10 minutes on this phone or talk on a call for 20 minutes or do some normal gaming like candy crush for 30 minutes then this phone gets very hot and the battery also gets drained faster than other phones.

This device is one the best with s series tag under 40k but the size of this phone is big and feels heavy. Apart from this everything is just awesome.

"Camera is average. People are making hype but only decent camera, not best in class. Telephoto camera captures soft picture at 3x zoom. Outcome does not contain good details."
"This Samsung galaxy s24 FE has a great camera setup, very good display with a nice design. Performance is also top notch. The special thing is the picture detail, it is really amezing also performs well in night condition also. The battery backup is not so good but the charging is fast, within 45 mins this mobile will be charged from 26% to 92% bcs I don't charge till 100% for the battery health. And yes, this smartphone gets hit when I am doing videography and in charging time."
"It is a very good mobile, it runs very smoothly"
Nice and awesome product
Battery backup is not good.
"Not good as expected, everything was Just normal. Compared to other mobiles launched in market now, this is not good as them, if you are willing to buy and s24fe better go for s23 fe which is lesser price or mobiles like Vivo v50. But this mobile is not a worth for 40k or 45k.Cameras are also not good as expected. The worst thing is Speaker sound, I can't even hear sound from Speaker in full volume some time."
I love it but the photos and videos of this item are not better than the Motorola edge 50 neo my previous phone.
"I transfer data from samsung Note 20 to this new one after completion, the phone got hang too much disappointed  on first daySee the screen got lock and nothing workingTotally disappointed from this"
Not good as  expect

Heating issue
"Mobile heating like Chinese Mobile in 1st charging only, Clipart selling refurnished Mobile i think don't but it , after using 5 mins am giving this feedback"
Very heating
Phone battery is draining continuously even after not using device
Battery backup was very very weak  5 mints in hand 5 % eat and major issue is heating
It is not all-rounder mobile . battery  very very week. Camera  one time best .one time not best. low-light camera  worst. Money waste.please select other barnd mobile select. To same prize.
Too much of heating issue for normal usage...Battery drain very fast...Overall Not satisfied in this price range..Don't buy and waste your money on this product..
Touch is not sensitive and the battery will drain at the earliest (with in a day)
Best smart phone on this range
"I really want to buy a snapdragon processor smartphone, but I did not wanted to spend to much on premium phones, I was also skeptical about battery because I know Samsung phones lacks in battery performance but I was quite surprise that all my doubts were vanished after using the phone, of course its too early to review, but I am enjoying this phone so far so good...I would definitely recommend it...."
"Best camera and performance phone under 40K, user experience is fantastic. Very much satisfied, value for money phone."
Very good performance

"For Daily Normal user....Camera quality awesome .Battery lifetime 7 to 8 hours.Display also awesome.Design feel premium .Performance good for normal use like Photography, video recording,  easy gaming, Editing and Watching Videos and short videos.Cons--Little heated when you are using 1 to 2 hours continuous.Some problem solved after first update.Overall good phone."

Samsung has truly hit a home run with this one, offering a premium experience without the premium price tag.First off, the display is stunning.

Network issue
Heating problem too high
Only heating is the main issue in this phone otherwise you can blindly choose this phone at this price range of 35k
"Overall this mobile looks good, but the cons in this mobile are1. Doesn't have app lock if one time phone is unlocked anyone can use anything.2. Even thought the battery has 4700 mah battery, the battery drains in no time.3. As other company mobile takes 15 to 30 mins to charge mobile this takes minimum 1 hour to completely charge it."
Excessive heating seriously hampers the overall experience.This not only makes the device uncomfortable to hold but can also lead to throttled performance and battery drain.
Camera quality Very bad
Motamuti
Battery problem
"Heating issue, weak in capturing network (my earlier mobile was excellent in it), not user friendly,  similar or better option is available in low cost, original charger is too costly, slippery big screen heavy phone is not easy to handle, think about above aspects before buying.."

Mobile good but heating issue
Go for it
Loved the product. The camera is so good and the performance is also very good even though it has an exynos chipset. The only downside is the avg battery backup (not much of an issue) and it only supports 25 watt chargng.
Heating issu
Excellent phone must buy...!!
"Great camera in this price range, looks great as well in hand with metal body, battery perforis average also it gets heated very quickly"
All the best phone nice very nice but battery is not backup only 5/6 hours
Some.times heat with heavy applications otherwise it's overall a good product for daily use.
"The Performance is decent. Although, Samsung could have used Snapdragon 8 gen 3 and also the battery doesn't run longer enough and it's pretty average"
Great Product
"Very nice and good looking phone , with great camera and display . Camera is very nice and that's the reason I bought it ... For me the battery is working fine as am not a heavy user and does social media but not gaming."

"All good except battery.Pros;1. Excellent performance2. Decent camera quality3. Good charging speedCons;1. Battery drains fast, weak battery performance.2.  Samsung UI is boring not like pixel/nothing UI.3. Galaxy UI doesn't feel so useful in day to day life."

"One of the best phone ever, loads of features, loads of customization, I got this for a great price. It has a better display, better camera and better software experience, but the performance is absolutely amazing. Disappointed with the battery service, it's quite decent, but it needs more charge if you use it heavily.  One thing I need to mention is, a complete best Smartphone. I recommend everyone if you have this same budget. #BestSmartphone #BudgetFriendly"

Covers most of the expectations.Battery draining and charging speed could have been improved.Could feel ah slight warmth and mild heat during intense use.
Everything is perfect...little bit concern is regarding battery...it should have had more capacity...though it ok.
Nice but heats a bit

Good pay
"Product is excellent,I am not satisfied with your courier partner"
Camera is very niceOver all nice phone
It's lagging too much..... I think flipkart sent me refurbished product that's why it's working slow
Good Phone
Bought on sale in 33k. Excellent phone and value for money. I worried about battery but it is also good than s21fe and 23fe.
Every thing is perfect in this phone except heating issue...If you use it for a long or play games it gets so hot very quickly...Except that every thing is perfect in this phone...

The battery backup is definitely around 1- 1.5 days.Camera : DecentPhone feels light in weight , though on specification it is 208 gms , but feels like 160 gm in hand.Sperakers output is too good."

"Awesome phone the navy color looks so good, design is fantastic. Speakers r not like Samsung with default settings but when slider is set to 15-20% towards R the effect increases. The caller speaker (L) acts as a 2nd speaker so thats why sound quality weakens on default. Depends on person to person.A single charge 100% at around 9am will give all day backup (without heavy usage like games and all).But its a go for it phone for sure. No regrets. Delivery was very slow that's the only issue."
Nice camera and display
For a Budget phone it's overpriced. Performance is ok. It's a decent product for the price. But overall features are great. If You are not into gaming and don't want to spend on Galaxy S series lineup then you can consider this phone.
Good performance.Good discount from flopkart. Only disadvantage is the more weight compare to other mobiles of same price
This is the best camera phone is segments
Brand is brand
Heating issue n also camera is ok ok

There are 2 concerns* phone weight is more, it feels bit heavy as compared with parity phones of Vivo, Redmi etc* Batrery is slow. It gets charged slow and drains fast.

This device is very good but it's battery performance is not goodI wish in future battery performance will be improve
Superb performance￼
Go for it guysBest mobile
Not bad..not value for money
Everything is good but very much heating issue in this that's why battery drains fast when device heats

Very good camera and fast processor

Fine
"This phone make me happy greater than expected,thank you so much for this service"
Battery backup is very bad and phone overheatingDon't buy
Samsung phone is always good design battery camera looking so good
If you are a light phone users who actually use your phone for camera and phone calls it's a best option for you but if you are into gaming a lot this might not be the right choice for you honestly because it gets warm so if you want realistic picture and natural looking videos on a budget it's best and you can definitely go for it and the performance is also pretty good on this price
Awesome  phone
"Body made with plastic, camera quality is poor. Battery back is not upto the mark. Basic drawback is Samsung not provided adeptor"

"I am facing a heating issue.performance sometime not better.But battery, display, design and camera are better.So that I don't recomme this because high heating issue."
Smooth and shine good quality
Samsung is the very best
Excellent phone battery and camera quality is amazing only drawback is little bit thicker and heavy.. but it won't matter if you use one or two days
A35camera was amazingBattery  5 to 6 hrs only comeDisplay awesomeLook so goodPerformance okAnd the most important thing is very heating up
"Expect battery performance, it is one of the best phone , it's display with smooth touch sensitivity is awesome, and the design is top launchThank you, filpkart."
"Poor Quality in calling, camera and battery"
Best...
Mobile is nice
Happy
Functions are good.. But.....
Migrated from a 51 to this a 35. Smooth experience
Love it
If there ever was a perfect phone then this is it. Great camera. Light and quite durable. Amazing performance. Good battery life (not bad at all tbh). Timely software updates. Quite compact and easy to carry. What more can you ask from a phone?
Thankyou flipkart and thanks for samsung company
Over heating
Display and performance and build quality is the bestAnd the camera and battery are averageOverall a good package totally satisfied
Camera is awesome
Awesome Color
Fantastic
Very very good product fantastic Johnny this mobile future very nice
Samsung always love you
It heats up very fast
"This mobile has a sharp screen, good battery life, and a decent camera for photos. It's smooth for everyday use, but not the best for high-end gaming. The design is sleek, and it's easy to hold. A solid choice if you're looking for a budget-friendly phone."
Good for the price segment. Performance and design is good. Camera is good but not as good as A73. Built is slight thick. Specially after using A73 it looks bulky. Other features are good and phone is working fine.
Excellent design!
good picture quality camera... but battry backup bad quality and charging slow full charge after 2/3hours
Very worst phone from Samsung. Only design is good. Out speaker volume is not good and battery backup is not good.
Heating iss
"Overall good produc, but gets slightly heated which is ok."
"Very Bad Performance , Very Bad Phone , Don't Purchase This Device."
"In terms of Camera and Performa ,this phone is fine but Battery is disappointing,  not seems like 5000mah, and too display not emits that much of brightness, Under sunlight some what seems like dim display"
Overall its good product from samsung before I used s21fe it was so heating and battery was terrible experience and right now I just enjoying more and happy to use samsungA35 and it's battery was almost getting me like around 7to8hours SOT thank you samsung  and camera was average and  it was good in sunlight pics but low light worst pics getting.. overall out of 5 I will give 4 stars
Just good for official person.
"Very good phone, but has heating issue, especially while charging."
Nice mobile in thiS budget go for it
99.99% Good
Satisfied with it's features design in this range..
Phone is heating just after unboxing
"Great camera for both photos and videos, the phone handles day to day tasks and casual gaming sessions easily. Software experience was not that great as samsung keeps delaying updates since one ui 6.0"
Touch does not works up to the mark and battery drains out quickly
"I think this is the best all-rounder smart phone at that price range. No problem found in day to day use. But some time it may be heat up during gaiming and charging. It is a feature rich phone with great softwar experience. The battry, camera, porcessor and display are quite good, which provide a smooth and lack free experience. I especially want to mention the security features about the phone. It is a highly secure phone, you can uninstall almost every app (except google apps and 2 or 3 sa...READ MORE"

DO NOT GO FOR THIS MOBILE. WORST CAMERA
I can't believe samsung is making this type of devices in these days when many other better options are available in even much better prices. Camera quality is too poor to be compared with VGA camera. Overall waste of money product.
"Battery backup very bad, poor camera,  no parches this phone"
Very nice awesome phone
Some wt heavy and heating problemIt's not slim it's extra thin
very nice smart phone smooth
Not happy with this product. The camera is not good. The battery runs out quickly.Overall very disappointed with the product.

"No issues faced in 5 months, touch sensor needs to improve or location of touch sensor to be on screen."
"Over heating issue.Network Jio 5g not Working.Battry is very poor, not hole day with normal usases.Perfect design, but screen bezzel to much.Performance not Good.Vibration is not good. Call Vibration, not feel in pocket.Total west of money."
It's good. Looks amazing and all but it gets heated up real quick. So I think u won't be able to play games for long and all
"Camera is decent but front camera is disappointing in low light , battery is also good for normal user can go for it it 20k"
Good one.
"Since 15 days i used this mobile. I impressed this mobile a camera, design, and display. Camera is a WOW! Battery is not about good. Comparatively My old samsung galaxy F12. Indisplay fingerprint taking time to unlock. Performance wise not yes used."

"While the phone offers decent functionality, it falls short of high performance. It lacks premium features or standout qualities that might make it an exceptional choice. However, it is still reliable for general, everyday tasks like calling, texting, browsing, and social media.For someone looking for a straightforward device that meets basic needs, this phone is adequate. But those seeking advanced features or high performance may find it limited."
Thank you filpkart
PRODUCT RECEIVED GOOD. TIME ALSO CORRECT
It's a good budget phone.

Best budget phone with big display
Good phone at this price segment.

Good phone about this proce
It's good under 6k. Just the camera is very decent.. which is fine in this price range
The mobile gets very hot while using it.
Best at this price range.
"Not accept to charge horrible, waste of money. Don't buy it"
Camera - good photos in day light and moderate sharpness . Colour reproduction not accurate.Display - 6.7 HD+ . if it's 6.4 or 6.5 display it will be great as it will enhance resolution quality and battery life plus more handy.Fingerprint sensor missing. Face recognition available but sometimes it doesn't recognise face. So need to re-register face. Samsung should fix this issue.Touch response just satisfactory.
Best ever smartphone for my mom use the phone
Worth the money
Slow phone but ok with the price point.

Display:-9.9/10Performance:-8/10Front Camera:-3/10Back Camera:-8/10Colour of Display:-10/10Battery:-8.5/10If you say that why I give less number to front camera out of 10 then I say that it is so bad but it is right that in this price range you can't expect better.In this price range SAMSUNG F05 is the best phone of all other brand's mobiles.
Excellent performance this price rangeAnd good mobile family members

Camera Quality
"Awesome product,,thanks to flipkart... value for money"
"This Galaxy F05 phone is awesome. Never used such smooth 4g android phone. I will suggest if anyone want 4g budget phone go for it. Samsung have best optimization, multitasking is smooth. Motorola, poco and other Chinese manufacturers can't compete with Samsung in terms of optimization of software. Samsung have improved a lot. This 12 nm Helio G85 is working best with Samsung's optimizations."
Good mobile thanks to flipkart
Vry nice  I am happy

"As per price, good phone, but no 5G"

Ok not bad not great ...basic smartphone.Pros:5000 mah decent battery backupGood displayAndroid 14 (2 OS update)Cons:No fingerprintLess ram and storageAverage performanceConclusion: without much expectations go for it... basic mobile

"Camera is average average. Display is good.But let me tell you, I have Realme Narzo 20 which has almost the same specs, but still its better than this phone. The camero is 48 MP, and 4 yrs old, still better than this phone, processor is Helio G85, still its better than this samsung phone. Samsung has just famous for its brand value. According to prize range, yes its value for money. I bought it for my uncle and he is happy with the product."

Nice phone for samsung
Very nice fone
"The phone offers good value, and design is great but for some reason, all icons appear somewhat dull low quility and not sharp. Perhaps Samsung will address this issue with future updates. Otherwise, it's a solid phone for day-to-day use."
"The front camera of the phone is very poor, it says 8MP but feels like lower than 2MP as well.I have received the product today so still about to experience the battery and software.@samsung - The front camera is very very very poor as compared to other any phone in this proce range, also no charger available with this."
Very slow and hangs often. Loaded with additional apps which makes it even slower.
"At least it should have a fingerprint sensor and 90hz display.. Because Poco C61 is providing these all the features in much cheapest price!! I have purchased this handset just because, I'm using samsung mobiles since I'ld have been started to use mobile phone. That's why. Thank you.."

The most value for money smartphone available in market is F05. Speed is the only issue but just uninstall unnecessary apps which are already installed and your phone will work faster.

Display screen is very cheap and low quality. Little dash broke my display screen within 4days of buying. Falling from 8 inches height... I am shocked. Silly damage. I thought how company selling without testing and quality check of display screen. I can't believe samsung mobile company do like that. And flipkart also not checked the quality of product.  Randomly selling without any quality check. I am unsatisfied with this product.
Phone performance worst
Reels will lag everytime and play blurry. Rest is fine video watching experience not good.
Look wise m05 is better.
I purchased for my motherJust loved the Looks and design

Just amazing   in this budget  thanks flipkart
Value for money best one
Good hanging problem
Good 5g mobile..
Camera quality very good
"The phone looks very handsome. Overall Samsung is for people who want to get their work done. I think this phone is a good purchase especially if a senior person like parents, is going to use. It's more than enough for their day today tasks. One reason to get this phone is to have better calling experience which most of the high spec budget Chinese phones lack."
Very nice phone value of money
Battery is drain faster
Very nice looking
Nice...
Classic phone as always from the Samsung house. Phone thickness is slightly more than the M series versions. Battery comes up for 1 day with routine usage on 5G network
This one of the best samsung phone under 17 thousands. Its display is so smooth and in this phone many functions are.my experience in this phone is so good if anyone want to buy this phone he or she buy this phone any doubt. My personal experience of this phone i saw that this phone battery is so good i watch this phone 1 and half days and this phone charge within 1hour 5minutes.i suggest everyone that this phone is so good
Nice phone.  Works well without any lag.  Flipkart exchange is a farce.  They quote high exchange amount during purchase and reduce the amount during delivery.  Bad exchange experience.  Phone is awesome
All good nice phoneI love it
Delivery is on time and product packaging was good
"Good handy phone, Must buy"
Mobile is good no doubts
Using more than 1 months good performance ... fell many times but it is so strong that nothing happened ..I m satisfied
"I am rating this product after using it for 100 days. I would say that the camera of this phone beats the iphone cameras. Really a nice one. I would suggest samsung to keep the UI clean, no need to add too many features. It disturbs many people like us. I am myself a techie who professionally work on developing mac applications but I still love simple things"
"Nice collour,  very good performance, looking very nice"
Performance is very slow and To much hanging problem in phone
"In a word Samsung Galaxy A15 5G(6, 128) is the best and cheap model. Display is AmoLED, Camera quality is too good, battery backup is average, OS update is so fast, RAM is working totally. I'm always with Samsung as I have used the Galaxy J7 Prime since 7 years.Go for it, believe me it will be worthy for you."
Phone is working amazing. Battery is okay-ish. Easily navigable. Quality camera.
"This phone iss very fabulous ,"
Best phone at this price
Low budget price and good performance device camara display battery powerfull product Samsung is best performance products and money for value items

No one can challenge the camera of this smartphone.  This will be beating up every smartphone upto 4-5 years.
Great camera
Just love the performance and looks
"Best samsung flagship purchase, Nice Smartphone awesome camera Great features and amazing s-pen really loved it."
Top notch display. The flat design with titanium frame feels premium. Camera could've been improved as it is same as that of 23 ultra. But may be it will get better with future updates.
Great design. Easy to use. Very nice performance so far.
The Phone is really awesome in terms of performance as well as looks wise.
"Excellent Galaxy S phone as always. Samsung, you rock ."
"Product is really good. You can buy it now even in April 25, only you really needs it. 1 lakh rupees for phone is something not recommended....Sound could have been more better.... else all things are good"
"Thanks, Samsung, for making such awesome phone! 24 Ultra beats IPhone 15 pro max in all aspects"
"Overall the phone is very good, upgraded from 21 ultra, seamless upgradation through smart switch. Camera is awesome, 100x is also decent. Integration of AI is definitely something to look forward to."
"Unbelievable zooming clarity, just one day over, Good battery.But in box, charger and headset required for this price"
The New King of 2024.
Display is awesome One UI doing great workCamera is out standing
Mind blowing device just wow....
"Best camera,display, sound, user interface and features.battery backup is too good."
"Fab software and capable hardware to match it, ergonomically it may not be very comfortable to hold.+ Good weight balance, feels sturdy and well built.+ Super impressive haptics and strength can be varied at various levels+ Very less screen reflections, using dark theme is a breeze with this phone"
Great product at great price!
Excellent Phone
"Its grrrreat. There's nothing missing in this device. Screen is superb, camera is great , performance is flagshippy.Battery runs at least a day for me. One always wishes for more in this department. Fast charging is limited to 45W.It looks amazing, feels amazing phone. Worth the hype."
"Samsung S24 Ultra after 5 months of usage:*Display:* The Dynamic AMOLED display still impresses me with its vibrant colors and crisp resolution. No complaints here!*Performance:* The phone's performance remains seamless, handling demanding tasks and multitasking with ease.

"Superb Phone, with best processor,you can any Android game in any mode. Camera clicks world's best photos. Mind blowing  , Flawless Phone"
"S24 Ultra is a great flagship phone. Bought mine during the launch with offers and I'm so glad I chose this over pixel 8 pro. Cameras are good (may not be as good as Pixel), design is so unique. Love the flat screen, it's so practical. Display is top notch! My previous 2 phones were OnePlus and seriously considered OP12 as well,  but the AI features stood out. Phone software is well optimised and battery lasts me full day fully. I use 25w charger and it charges from 35-100% in around 50mins. ...READ MORE"
Performance: 5 Display: 5 Cemara: 4 Battery: 4 Overall: 4
One of the best mobile i have ever used. Moved to this from iPhone. Beast of a mobile.
"Everything is perfect the design, display and performance and the Battery and Camera I would say is neither bad nor great, it's GOOD. Battery lasting more than 18 - 20 hours with 7 - 8 hours of SOT. If you get a tempered glass kindly get a thin one, because if you get a thick one the Ultrasonic sensor won't work even if you increase your touch sensitivity.Overall a great flagship experience everyone should at least use once in your life time."
Osm Good experience
I think this is the One of best phone  and the camera of the phone is so better
Awesome phone..just go for it.
Best samsung ever!
These are some of clicks and it takes awesome pictures and the AI is working beyond the level.
1.performance is next level you can play any game with out lag.2.battery is not as expected3.display is awesome 4.Camera is top notch in this mobile5.Amazing AI featuresoverall it's an amazing phone only issue with battery backup
Clearly the best flagship phone of the year. I am reviewing it after 3 days of use.Pros:1. Fast and Smooth performance2. Awesome Camera and it's features are best3. Galaxy AI is Good initiative yet to improve4. Best Display5. Battery is awesomeCons:1. Live translation will work only for Hindi Language moreover Google translate is more accurate than Samsung translate
S24 ultra nice but  at time of exchange delivery not give price as seen in exchange value although exchange products as per mark
Best phone in the world
I will be honest .the phone feel super premium and the one ui is icing on the cakeBut camera is not that great as hype overall but it still taking some good shots in extremely well lighting condition..In night or low performance is average
"No words to explain this mobile, Galaxy 24 is the best in the universe."
"Just fabulous. The king of Android phones for 2024 already. Incomparable to any other Android smartphone. An ace in all departments, whether it is stability, gaming, performance, camera, or overall usage and security. Not to forget the AI features, they are really handy and useful. If budget is not an issue then just go for it don't look anywhere else."
I want to share following point regarding this phone.1) Camera -  As this is Camera centric phone as Samsung advertising but camera doesn't meet to the expectation if we are considering price point of view. There are modes given for the camera which are old one only and camera clarity for the rear camera is ordinary and not showing any proper upgradation with compare to galaxy S 23 ultra. Front camera to too bad I can say. When you try to capture the photo with front camera comes very pixel...READ MORE
Phone is fantastic no doubt aboutit . Love it's Display. Surrounding sound quality is at the top notch. Performance and speed is of next level. Camera would have been better compared to it's price.

My Dream Smartphone.Awesome Experience with this device. Thanks too SAMSUNG.
"We have various options in the market. Thought to go with IPhone 15 pro max,but in the end Samsung has nailed it in every department.Camera and video quality is top notch.After intensive phone usage I am getting good amount of battery backup. AI features took the phone to the next level. Took the moon photo in manual mode and the output came very well. Camera is working great in low light conditions.

I'm in love with this phone. Though the camera quality isn't as good as my iPhone 12.
"Awesome mobile. Everything you could ask for, it is there in this piece of technology. Samsung's One UI has many customization options. Cameras are amazing. You get DSLR like portraits from the camera if there is sufficient light. Night photography can still be improved.  Otherwise everything is perfect. The battery also lasts more than 1 day on normal usage. Screen is very bright even under direct sunlight.

The Phone is amazing. Only 1 issue. I pre-ordered the Phone and a samsung wireless charger was supposed to be a benefit of pre ordering. I did not receive the charger. Deducting 2 stars for that.

Best phone and much better than. IPhone go for it beyond doubts a very great phone
I'm happy
S24 is the best phone at this time.
If you are planning to buy for office and CLG stuff then this is the best option you got if you are willing to spend that much and stop comparing with iphone both phones are best in their own perspective iphone is more over person gadget which won't give us the freedom to explore various things and perform different things which we can do by samsung s24ultra
"Excellent phone with awesome AI features and best camera. The display is top notch with snapdragon gen 3 processor, making it a power house performer."

Great performance
Best of best.I have no complaints.Display is awesome with almost no reflectionSound amazing.Camera amazingBattery backup SOT upto 6hrs for mePerformance top notch although I m not power user.Fully satisfied with s24 ultra.Probably a phone for next 4 or 5 years it has all features uptodate for next 5 years atleast
King of android is here.No one can beat samsung s24 ultra with this price and specifications.
For taking photos the best phone and the premium quality of the mobile is too tooo tooo goood.....if u have money go with samsung S24 ultra instead of iPhone
Wonderful product .. Camera is Wonderful..AI is worilking wonderfully... Battery life is aslo very good ..
"Good product, bit expensive, but who can afford may go fit"
Phone edge too sharp... when hold long poking...Otherwise overall gud...
Just woww ! Samsung did a great job:)
"Best of best.Camera is awsome even in low light it is capturing such a high details photos without any efforts. Battery life is decent, atleast with one charger you can spend a day with moderate screen usage. S pen is very useful which is very usual for note series customers.phone doesn't lag. Sound is awsome too.Only thing I am missing is the sd card...as mariners like us always doesn't have full access to the internet..so it is major drawback from my personal view point."
"The Samsung S24 Ultra phone impresses with its stunning industry leading AMOLED display, delivering vibrant colors and crisp details. Its powerful Snapdragon processor ensures smooth performance even during multitasking. The versatile camera system captures stunning photos and videos, while the long-lasting battery keeps you connected all day. An exceptional flagship device."

Awesome Camera Quality..
World best Fone..
I feel this phone camera  software needs improvement. Blur photo when taken pics in evenings. Also battery utilization  needs to be improved. Charging phone daily because charge goes from 100% to 1% daily.Otherwise this phone design and display  really looks nice
Best phone from samsung
The King of Android mobiles.
The phone is fantastic and very attractive. The battery backup is very good.  But better to give charger along with phone.
Excellent display and camera

Excellent performance phone
"Very good looking premium phone, it feels right away when you hold it. The matte finish in the back looks superb.In terms of camera quality I think it will give similar results like a S23 Ultra nothing substantial difference but front camera is better optimised.Rest AI features I have not explored much but that would be interesting and probably a big USP of this phone.Overall happy with the purchase and will definitely recommend if you like the Galaxy Ecosystem as I had to change my primar...READ MORE"

Good And Awesome
30% of android applications are not working due to new android version
This phone really is the definition of a truly premium device. Infact this looks better than S25U with its sharp edges and a truly rectangular screen and body.
"Camera,  battery and display are too good..A lil on heavier side with sharp edges, so might feel uncomfortable for gamers.S- Pen is very useful in photo editing,  signing,  taking short notes,  etcOverall a very good buy for long term usage..."
Loved this phone
"Don't buy from this seller and also from Flipkart, I've purchased this mobile on 17/12/24 and received a pre activated device which was activated on 01/12/24 and now samsung says it's Flipkart's fault and filpkart say's samsung gonna take care of this stucked in between force to keep this device.....Hate to both of you"
"After using Samsung J7 Max in 2018, switched to other Chinese smartphones for better android experience.This time Samsung has successfully delivered the most intelligent device which will give you ultimate experience of android as well as IOS. Everything is running properly with the most advanced artifical intelligence technology."
If your looking to switch from iPhone 14 pro or 15 pro than this is not phone for you.I regret switching but not bad.Camera is less crispy and detailedbattery backup is lessphone gets heated soon when comparing to my previous 14pro maxless handyslow charging
NOT Good As The Havoc Created About This Device .The Camera Is Same As S23 Ultra .The AI Feature Is Not So Useful As Think .Try Some Other Device In Compare To This One .
"Not a Good Choice,  it does not even support the basic desiresno support for dual appsno toggle option of numerical in keyboard (samsung)no network speed indicatorcamera zooming is best, but photo  clarify..normal one is not the bestoverall not happy,  its not worth the money we spent"
Superb Display!  #visuals #stunning #eye-catching
Just awesome!
"Not at all happy with camera and display performance, it's just hype. Far away from A15"
Poor camera quality .display top notch. AI features not much useful. Battery average..not worth the price tag
mic is not working....
No value for money.  Not much difference with s23 ultra..

Better to shift to 4G and 60 hz display to make it last longer.Camera is best No heat issues. Compact device and it's fast.Performance is excellent.
I have used iPhones for 6 years until i changed to Android in 2023 with the Samsung S21FE. I upgraded from S21FE to S25. One of the finest upgrade I must say. I am staying with Samsung.
"A great phone. I have shifted from poco to samsung and feel that it's a great decision. No lag, no heating, great performance. Camera quality is great. UI is also good and AI features are also great. I feel charging is a bit slow. It takes almost 1 hour 15 minutes to reach 90 to 100% . But I feel it's good for longer battery life. Rest are great.

Awesome product.  Just loved it.
The phone is a true flagship packed in such a compact handy size. Love the camera and UI. Played 120fps smooth in BGMI.Only wish it supported atleast 45W charging
"If you are worrying about battery life, don't. This one easily gives 6 to 7 hours of screen on time. Incredible efficiency for such a small battery. Camera however is not that great for the price. Still decent. Everything else is just excellent. If you want a small Android phone that has the best of everything, this is the one to go for."
THANK YOU FLIPKART
"Got a best deal, great mobile."
Bode hit hona.  very bad product
Samsung should recall the devices and a more powerful battery should be placed in the device to make it a satisfactory experience.   I firmly believe that most of the customers are of the same opinion.
"If you're looking for a great compact phone, this is an excellent choice. It features a good screen and impressive battery life."
Performance and comfort is outstanding..But camera is not upto mark..its below average..My friends s23 also takes same image quality as s25...in 60k range many phones take better image quality...so camera is worst as price range... although samsung 30-40k range phones capture same image quality..
Outstanding Mobile
"Exchanged with iphone 15 ,got excellent dealOverall is a better phone than iPhone 15 except cameraDisplay os battery in hand feel is excellent just camera needs update"
Best Compact size Phone with amazing AI features

And to talk in short, this is absolutely worth the money.I got this for my parents, and as they're coming from Samsung, I was a bit sceptical about switching here since I heard a lot about ads and bloatware.

Good battery backup 13-14 hrs screen on time. For Normal usage one and half day guaranteed . Camera is not that much good. Only avarage. Display is better. Sound also good. Very satisfied. 15 days usage review
Battery performance best
Performance is goodCamera averageFeatures very goodBattery backup will be best if your phone has 304 version software which is available in old stock means of you got old stock like march April then best otherwise latest stock come after  software update and that update is not good for battery back up . don't update 501 version you will get less battery backup but in 304 you can get 13+ or 14+ hours
It is completely defining its price
Excellent quality on this budget
Overall Good device this price range. My first oppo device And my experience with this device is still good. It is a good phone for normal uses and choose it according to your criteria.
Good for family
Very beautiful
Free fire is currently at 60 FPS but performance is killer at it price range also phone doesn't heat up while gaming with quite decent camera with Good  photo.
Now Oppo is known for it's K- Series.

"K13 is an awesome device ! Got a powerhouse 7000mAh  battery + 80w Supervooc superfast charger and monstrous gaming performance with Snapdragon 6 Gen4 +  5700mm cooling chamber for gaming without heating. And guess what, it clicks amazing snaps too with 50MP AI camera... Best buy indeed."

Okay good
Good and fastest mobile and super battery backup
"Here's a more detailed review:Overall performance is good as per the price but one thing which I really feel is the dimension of this mobile is a bit big, it is definitely not bulky but yes you can't access or use the device with a single hand. Moreover, this phone is a powerhouse! The processor is lightning-fast, the camera takes stunning photos, and the display is vibrant and crisp. Battery life is also impressive, easily lasting a full day with moderate use. However, I do wish it were a ...READ MORE"

"Overall, it's good, but for the earphones, we need an extra C-Type cable they could have included it in the box."
Flawless. Absolutely loved it
The performance is not as great as the reviewers are praising it. But if you want to use it daily and want a phone with a big battery then I recommend you to buy it because I am doing it. Its battery is amazing and the phone looks beautiful.
One of the best handset under 20k
"Un satisfied with back camera ,it's coming dark not expecting like in oppo"

"The OPPO K13 is a good phone overall, but despite having a large 7000mAh battery, the battery backup is not as good as expected. Previously, I was using the Vivo T3x with a 6000mAh battery, and it offered better battery performance. OPPO should work on optimizing battery efficiency."
Got a defective one it take 2.5 hrs for charging
According to the Price it's good!
Camera is not taking a good quality photo so It is very poor to compare to price value and things are ok battery backup excellent  and design all ok sound quality good I recommend to buy this phone to all of us because it is value for money phone
Just awesome with all specifications
Overall the product is good
Nys phone

Super mobile on this price.
Good Battery Backup and hang free operation
Under 20k best mobile phone
Everything Good Except Camera.
Overall good phone in this budget with a good battery life
Phone is getting heated and Battery draining very quickly.
The processor is okay. I have been using it for the 1 week and I can tell you that I really liked the battery of this phone. It's working well for the price......
"Over all who needs mobile with internal memory,battery and camera is best in all this combo at one plce"
Smule app not supported properly (vocals voice matching issue)
Looks। Great
Battery backup not expected
I initially thought the camera would be very bad but I realised it's actually pretty decent(don't expect too much) but there is no wide camera. Also the performance is good on heavy games. The battery is really great and fully charges in 45 mins. Don't forget to buy a case with this as the white back cover gets yellowish fast.Overall the phone is worth the money!!
Battery performance is very low it's not a 7000mah oppo making fool to people
"Amazing phone for the price, hdr is missing in the displayEverything else is just better than flagship phone 3 years ago, and still beats current flagship 1lakh rs, phones in battery and charging,"
Lack of basic settings like second screen and multiple users options doesn't make any sense
It has a 7000mAh battery but it does not work like a 7000mAh battery
5G connectivity problem in this device it has not proper 5G Bands
Nice Phone with Nice battery
While charging the mobile get heating....
Incoming call sometimes not audible
5G network not working properly

Excellent phone with long battery backup and smooth performance with a good quality camera
"Battery drain faster not a 7000 mah batteryOnly 5000 mah perfomanceAvarage mobileDisplay,speakers and charger niceBattery performance worstOppo frist mobile perches ana last mobile"
Ok okay
Phone Is Very Heat
It is offer excellent value with a vibrant 120Hz AMOLED display and powerful snapdragon 6 Gen 4 Processor.
It is a good product you can consider if battery and fast charge good display then it is a nice deal for you but camera is average but no doubt it is very smooth ufs 3.1 does a magic  to it.

Over priced in this segment. But my friend's choice is that he likes the phone

Excellent Mobile for the Price

"Everything is just Opppp... But camera and gaming is decent....

I also have 8/128"
Thanks to Flipkart excellent product given
pros......its a decent phone with good battery and slim design        cons....display is not vibrant and speakers are not loud
"Camera is average. Battery is good but not as good as 6500 mAh should. Display is LCD but it's a good display.  I don't like the funtouch OS. It doesn't give you much options for customisation. You cannot customise icons and  control centre icons like realme. Poor Aesthetic and slightly heavy. Although phone is very good, performance wise."

This phone awesome  High performance  Best quality
Good Quality This ProductBattery Very Very NiceCamera Super Display Smooth
A very good phone to consider with 256 gb so it can be considered for long term. Only problem is little bit heating but for a day to day life use this is fantastic and very impressive design and display
Budget friendly phone with very good rear camera and battery.A rear feature of 'IR Blast' is included
Good for Day to Day task
This is an all-rounder phone. It would have been even better if it had earphones or a separate jack. I am happy with this phone
Excellent mobile for day to day usage.
Absolutely value for money device.Animations are at par with flagship devices.
This is very important smart phone battery for super is camera  very nice
Excellent performance
"Within Budget provided all daily requirement, if you are non gamer person, just Bang on... No 2nd thought"
Good phone for this price
Mobile is great but I don't recommend to buy on exchange from Flipkart
Everything is good but the only drawback is LCD display.Next time Vivo will improve the all rounded mobile for this budget
You can go for it value for money with discount and I am a big of fan vivo and iQOO mobile
Value for money  but the 256 variant is little too overpriced
"I bought this mobile, this mobile is very excellent in all parameters like camera 50 mp , storage UFS 3.1 256 gb, battery 6500 mah ,IR blaster ,etc..."
Worth to buy
Nice mobile gud perfomanceDelivery boy very very bad behaviour some extra charges

Best battery  backup
One of the best phone under 15kOverall good
Very nice performance 5/4Nice battery backup 5/5Camera quality very good4.5/5Vivo was fire
1. Design and looks. Although subjective but I feel thin and ship. Great on design.2. Camera For this price range. Camera and image processing is top class.3. Battery is great . 1.5 days normal usage. Stil 38 percent left.4. Processor is fast. No lag. No hearing on basic usage.5.  Sound output is ok ok. Could have been better.6. No 3.5 mm jack. Sad7. Overall a great product and total value for money.
Vivo is doing a great job with performance and features.Great performance.Good and bright display.Battery amazing.Camera department is fine. Don't expect samsung galaxy S series or iphone like photos. You are getting a value for money camera. You will not get disappointedFinger print and face unlock works like a charm.AI algorithms are good in the photos segment.Software experience is pretty good.Bit bloatware but manageable.
Nyc phone but at this price vivo should give Amoled Display...IPS Display not good
Battery bakeup was not well bt all over good
Camera performance is poor
"The camera is totally useless in this price point, the other 50 mp cameras are better than this device camera, everyone who buy this phone for all rounder then, don't buy this phone"
Audio quality is really bad no dolby Atmos at 18000 phone really not happy
"The product is good at this price but the brightness automatically goes down somehow , and sometimes does not responds to touch"

What a phone at this price
Very Bad cemara performancePlease Return it
First of all one question to Flipkart.What you mean by secure package fee?Not even Buble cover. Simple ordinary package. Looting the customer by taking secure package fee.. come to the review of phone.Display 5/5.Both cameras 4/5.Battery 4/5Performance 2/5Laging too much. They have to rectify it.Night photoshoot very bad if there is no sufficient lightOverall good for the price
best phoneBattery is goodDisplay is good with 90hzCamera is also good at this pricePerformance is ok for daily using appsNot recommended for gaming
Value of moneyMotorola nowadays give tough competition

Mobile is good at this price range only Battery Charger is slow
All ok but i don't understand why the 5100 mah battery written on the label on phone boxThe official phone has 5200 mah battery so what's the problem can any one tell me?
Overall is good in this price range. Camera is awesome
"Mobile is not like any budget segment phone, the design, the camera quality, the speaker quality, the display, the UI, the performance everything is TOP NOTCH no complaintsBut the cons are,No IR sensorSlow chargingThat's it.Overall it's best in this segment"
Very nice camera and battery life is to long..Nice product

Good Mobile.Fast performance..
Awesome mobile worth buying at this price range. Red color is very good. Display quality is brilliant. Battery back up is good. I'm very satisfied with this mobile.. Thank you Motorola and flipcart
"The device lags at times, slow charging and is significantly slow for day to day tasks. But it has a good display, decent UI and does basics well. Doesn't look like a 7k phone. The 18W charger is not there. It comes with 10W standard adapter for charging. Charging takes quite a bit of time."

Fabulous product
Amazing picture amazing phone
Camera is below average.
This mobile takes time to get up once after display disappeared.surprised how slow this mobile is even after having 4GB RAM as claimed by manufacturer.Price is directly proportional to quality
Really a good product at this price range.I use it as my secondary device which completes my requirements. Also feels like a premium phone in hand.Far better than other phones at this price.

Superb present condition
"Unexpected price,quality and performance,the best experience"
Very nice mobile products
"Feels a bit slow, ram extender is enabled by default which is not helping any way and causing battery drain so disable it.The phone is fine if you are taking for parents or you have light usage."
Don't buy this this mobile having software issues
First of all the phone is goodIt's ui and software is awesomeI can play bgmi in smooth + ultra graphics however a little leg can be seen . Camera quality is not so good.Display is bright enough and quality is also good.

"Lagging, battery heating, and call connectivity issues (the voice is unclear on both ends). If these issues are fixed in updates, it might be fine, otherwise, it is a waste of money. Very disappointed!"
"The performance of the phone is very bad, sometimes the volume buttons don't work, sometimes the video doesn't play, sometimes the apps don't load, the performance is very bad. I am not happy with Motorola Edge 50 Fusion"

My love is so happy  thanks Flipkart
Great product (4.6/5)Camera excellent at *this* price range(OIS could have been better)Battery and design no complainOLED display could have been better. Hd+ is decent.Performance is very strong.Connectivities are working properly.Loved the loud speakers.Solid security but could have given at least 2 years of OS updates.Macro camera could have been raised to standard 8mp or 12mp.
"Good Product,,,"
"1. Best Budget Phone,2. Worth for Money,3. Back-Side Vegan Leather looks Premium4. Enough Battery Standing Time5. No Fussy Pre-Installed App like Chinese Phones6. Processor is Beyond this Price Range"
Phone is suprb. Descent spec considering budget. Where we can get warrenty related services? Is it available in all states?
Valuable for money
Good at this amount
Wonderful Product For this budget..Flagship Experience Under 12k.
Best for the budget segment.. Balanced performance as expected by moto products.. screen resolution could have been better.. as the pixel is visible while zooming the picture.. Also not good for content viewing
Good phone in this price segment.Go ahead.Good initial impression.।
Best at this price
"Excellent in everything, design,colour,performance,best budget phone,i recommend to everyone"
"Phone is good but basic appsMissing gallery, photo app have depend to google apps"
It's a best phone for normal use like For watching videos and phone calls some social apps like that would be best . i brought this for my mom and it's good for the price so I also buy it for my cousin brother
"Just AwesomeVery Good Mobile under Budget.The camera is decent, very good light adjustment, and the picture quality is good, and the Front camera is also capturing decent picsBattery backup is also awesome.Light weight mobile, Nice motorola gesture.I am using a motorola edge 50, bought this Moto G45 for my wife.I recommend this mobile to all looking for a budget mobile.Simple Super"
Battery Performance not good I have 2 more moto mobile but moto g 45 battery Performance very bad
"Delivery by Flipkart was good, received the phone in a day. When validating the IMEI # it said Motorola G34 5G. Though the specs of both the models are mostly similar, this is a cheap strategy by Motorola."
Over all a good phone as a secondary phone or as a minimalist phone..
Value for money! Got it for dad. He wanted a stock android mobile.And he's highly satisfied
Very bugs and heating essueBattery only one day after full charge without uses.Review after 5 day uses
"The best phone in the range of 13k compare with redmi, oppo, samsung, iqoo etc. Dolby sound is really a great performance, best design and a good camera quality. Battery backup is also satisfactory. Overall a very best choice. Go for it without any doubt. There are so many negative reviews but this phone makes it all wrong, it's a best choice."
"Don't buy Waste of money product1) no system default application for gallery, music, file manager2) no real-time network speed function3) no app lock - app encryption4) no private safe5) can't see how much data used today6) less ringtones7) heating problem8) complicated UI design"
Very nice phone sound is so good and camera is too good
Sometimes it gets hung. The battery gets drained very quickly. It's an average phone.

"Nice phone 8.5/10 considering the price range that it comes on, and 1 year of Android update is a major down side and a useless 2 MP MACRO sensor, display resolution should be improved or its brightness nits. You can go for it without any hesitation if you are looking for daily usage of phone or daily tasks, and can handle simple tasks.Performance: can give you up to 40 fps easily on high end games like BGMI, COD, APEX LEGEND,Genshin Impact 20-30 FPS Low to Medium settings.The camera qua...READ MORE"

The mobile was very nice  phone  and better all things like camera andperformance and display design the speakers were very amazingThanks for the nice phone
"Just an excellent product don't worry buy it, i think you should buy viva megneta colour"
The calling ringtone is not up to the mark. The sound is very late.
Was okay
My observation value of moneyFull sound time back side vibration  feel
Segment best all-rounder phone
Nice phone in this price segment..
"The processor and camera is so good at the price, the only problem is the gallery and file manager.Moto doesn't have gallery and file manager, but you can use Google photos and Google files"
Nice performance but display and camera average
"Bought this for mom, pink lavender colour and design looks great, display is so smooth, overall performance is great, just camera could have been a little better but at this price range its good"
"Great performance, big screen, feels solid."
Nice camera fast charging
Budget friendly mobile
For the price of 12000(with bank offer):this is a fairly good and functional phone.Hope it lasts next 5 years.the few bloatware that are pre-installed can be easily uninstall.camera performance by default is acceptable.
Quality and performance is good in this price range...
"Pros:Zero Bloatware in the mobile, I have to even download Compass from playstore.Battery runs for a day and half if normally used.Cons:-Camera could have been better.Brightness could have been more for outdoor usage."
Super mobail
Best Phone
Mostly From My Experience I will give it 4 StarCamera - Decent in this PriceBattery - Enough for a DayPerformance - Very Balanced PerformanceDesign - Best in this PriceDisplay - Bright Enough feels like AmoledAndroid - Comes with Android 14Sound - Best because of Dolby Atmos and also having Stereo SpeakersCharger - Not Supports Super Vooc Charge but it comes with Typical 20 Watt Charger
Good at this bud

Good mobile in this price range ..camera performance can be better ..rest all good..

Value of the product
Camera could be better
it's an amazing phone but regarding with battery backup I would suggest going for a better one even thought it has 5000 mah battery I don't feel the optimisation was enough to last one full day of use apart from that it's the best phone in this price segment
I have ordered this phone yesterdayReally niceWith Additional features
Nice product.value for money
Good Pho
Awesome product  thanks motoI have been using motorola mobiles from last 5 years and that's why I buy new motorola mobile phones
I am writing the review after 30 days from the purchase date. Overall is goodThe camera is the best in this segment.Display is good but 720pBattery  performance is okay okay
The performance it offers at the lowest possible price with 20W charger in the box is the best thing with a pantone colour design. Hats off moto!
This phone has a problem of battery and charging. Charging takes 3 hours and the battery gets discharged faster but it lasts all day. Otherwise this phone is very good. I am Shubham hu
Nice product but screen and camera will not fully satisfied according to its price .screen brightness is low and back camera 50 mp but work like 20 mp and front is 16 mp but work like 5 megapixel .overall price is decrease nor quality is increase by company.
Moto G45 is good phone but.1.phone battery drain very fast2. Camera is not good3. display4 performance 5. Sound quality very good 6 phone look is very premium quality
Dual speaker
"Overall a good buy. The response of the phone seems slightly sluggish with the 8 gb ram and snapdragon configuration. Touch also seems a bit slow. Doesn't look like a 8gb ram phone....The design and looks are good. The camera is also good. Features are good.Overall a decent phone, but could be better,....."
Affordable and budget phone classic look
Love this leather back design..
This product is goodWorth for money
Good for girlfriend
Budget Segment Mobile
Camera is so beautiful
Good product in this price...
Phone is very lighter to use that is the greatest advantage of it. Need to work on more smooth performance of software by moto and without lags. Camera needs to be more improved as it says 50 mp but not that exact it works actually. And battery should be atleast 6000 MAH as current battery last for one day only. Rest all is good.
Amazing mobile..it's beautiful n good performance so far.. very smooth and in budge
"Its a Good premium looking phone.Pros. No ads or bloatware.Battery backup is good.Performance is good for daily life use.Value for money phone.Looks premium in this segment.Cons.Camera is average.Customisation is limited,Many Feature not present.Display is average.Software update from moto is pathetic.Not for gamers."
It does the job

"The Moto G45 5G is a fantastic entry into the 5G smartphone market without breaking the bank. For its price, the phone delivers solid performance with its MediaTek Dimensity processor, ensuring smooth multitasking and gaming. The 6.5-inch 120Hz display is a standout feature, offering vibrant colors and smooth scrolling, which is rare in this price range.

Writing this review after a month of use.Design: goodPerformance: goodCamera: worst because it keeps on crashing and reboots the mobile.Overall: average phone with impressive looks.
Heating issue is a big problem. Battery life (Battery power back-up) is not up to the mark. I am providing this feed back just after 4 days of my purchase. If any one ask me about this phone then my simple answer is don't go with MotoG 45.
"Very Worst Camera ,BATTERY ok but the charging time is very High ,DISPLAY OK.DESIGN GOODPERFORMANCE is jst OK"
Sound quality is very poor and low volume
Battery  backup 7 hr only and the mobile heating problem
Phone using after 10 days i am seeing camera quality issue front camera totally waste please upgrade camera quality direct video call is not clear face me other person so guys please seen reviewing customer's before buying
Unable for OTG connection
"While talking he doesn't tell us anything, the speaker is not good"
Performance is very poorheating problem
"For an incoming call,the ringtone was silent for the five seconds and rings only after five seconds.I tried all phone settings.The problem still persists.I missed so many calls because of this problem.It is irritating and annoying to me."
Battery capacity 3 month down'Performance very badNot control for me
Charging speed is lowBattery drains fast
Very slow.      Not satisfied
I am facing call drop issues in the phone. I reached service centre for the same and they told me to go to Chandigarh for the problem to get resolved. They also said that they are getting these complaints from this model
Display poor quality
It's getting over heat if I use phone jst for 30min also
"Phone was just average,For the budget it's good,ui is not much user friendly even I can't customise a wallpaper as I wishFor just normal use this is good at this price range"
"Don't buy moto product, there are so many defects in this device. Finger print is not working properly, batter draying quickly, blutooth not connected automatically. I kindly request to all don't buy."
ok for price
Average smartphone
Not up to the mark
Power power
Consider only if you eager to buy a new set in budget
Good phone at this price rangeOnly Display is Not good ( 720P)For parents it's a best option
Mobile back finish good but processor little bit slow other wise lot of advertisement
With this price range we can't expect a great camera. But I'm not satisfied with the battery performance. It's going down fast and fast charging also takes more time.
"Everything was ok but, Phone is heating while you are playing game Or watching online videos for 1 hour + ...??"
Very heat in few minute
I think Motorola is best for meAfter one night useMy genuinely  opinion1. flipkart service best 5/52.phone look and design 5/53. Phone camera front 3/5 back 3.5/54. Battery 3/5 or less than that5. Let's hope phone work well
Average performance. Under 12k we can't expect more from moto. Suitable for elder people. Camera is very average only. If you want mobile in this range choose Vivo t3x 5g or realme P1 5g or oppo 12x which is far better.
Mic problem
Network issue. Performance is also not upto the mark. Overall big no no...

"A screen guard and cover should be provided with the phone,And should be given at 45W fast charging!"
"It's for normal user, average mobile.Some times display is not working properly.Other iteams are average."
Sim tool is vry poorFront camera is vry badBattery pickup is ok ok
Device keeps freezing/hanging/overheating/battery slow charging/
Budget friendly 5g Phone
All application is freez and Hang after few moments. Camera also caption time doesn't work.We suggestions moto user dont buy this model.
"Very good, value for money."
I used it for 4 months and it's still good to use but the battery is low performance
"not good phone , bad camera , bad screen , bad battery life time , dont by motorola g45 phone..."
"I have give 4 stars because, everything for this price is reasonable, but call voice quality is not good. I don't know if all mobiles have this problem or particularly mine only has this issue. Please everyone who have bought this mobile  share review regarding voice call clarity."
Good one from moto .

Very bad. Mobile is very heat problem  my money waste
Motorola g45 5G.. very nice good condition
Very worst product.. chargeing Full in 2 hours..
Charged once in the morning will stay 40 % by noon. I will switch off until night.

Font not clear
Using since January. Very low performance when compared with other mobiles of this segment. Not eligible for exchange even if u buy same Motorola mobiles.

Voice call sound Quality worst and no any customer care support
Day to day life usually normal use is best for home
Forest mobile mobile  was hanging like unbranded mobile worest
Ok for the budget

Microphone not working clear
Hanging and bad luck is no return policy
Design best hai
It has a major issue with the microphone. One cannot understand my voice during call.
Just a good phone in this range
Nice phone in the price range
Defective ya not working properly
Super display decent battery life premier design
"Look and feel in hand is same as G85. Performance and rear camera are improved for sure. But heat is felt in hand while using camera. Front camera's Portrait Mode has dynamic range handling issue, no touch to focus or exposure control till now. Battery drains fast in 4G but stable in 5G. All these can be resolved via OTA update. Providing no back cover and screen protector is surely a draw back."
Best in this range. Thank you moto for wonderful phone
Mid range beast
Battery draining fast one hour browsing consumes 10percentage even more in day time..not last for one day use.. disappointed with battery
Best camera phone under 20k
"Loved this amazingly new launched product with a hell lot of features in a pocket friendly phone, a phone with best features of camera display speakers and all of it. It is a must buy and with flipkart's 13 minutes delivery it just was too good to buy this phone."

Amazing product on this price ....motorola is making best.... loved it

"1. The phone is awesome and very light weight.2. Super thin and curved poled display is super.3. The battery is good, but might have some normal heating issues.4. The camera is also super in such a price range.5. All specifications are super go for it."
Loved the curved display!!! I would suggest it! It's worth it.
I am a Motorola User since 2022 September . Recently I had Motorola G52 4g . I got this one by exchanged Moto G52. This phone seems pretty good for normal use . Hope for the best experience from this like the last one did.

"The Moto G35 is a budget-friendly smartphone that offers decent performance for everyday tasks. It has a large, vibrant display, a long-lasting battery, and a capable camera system. However, the processor can be a bit slow at times, and the software support is not as long as some competitors. Overall, the Moto G35 is a solid choice for those looking for a reliable and affordable smartphone."

Phone works smoothly on normal use like phone calls, social media, watching webseries and anime etc... display and speakers are awesome in this category. Device doesn't heat up much on normal use.

camera is poor and battery is poor
This Motorola G35 Mobile phone is Just OK not so good and not so bad the moto company should have given atleast 6 GB Ram
1. Dislpay is having some dots while taking the delivery but still flipkart didn't agree to exchange it.2. Performance seems to be slow. Sometimes feeling little lag even 120hz refresh rate3. Battery back OK OK - with full charge it can sustain 1day with normal usage.4. Camera quality is good. But can be better.5. Leather design seems good. Feels comfortable.
It's ok for this price range
"Despite having the mobile handset ON, when a call is made it does not connect and shows Switched Off.This problem is continuously persisting."
Phon lags
Network issue call disconnected their are some issues and call recording sound recieved other person this is bad major issue
"Phone is good for who use very less I face heating issue and sometimes hang but look, camera and battery is better"
Gets heated a lot and also hangs several times
Battery backup is so poor as compared to 5000 mah on other brand...
Network issue.Low area coverage
Its so bad at network. So much problems in mobile data. Even though mobile data is On we can't use it it says it's not connected to network
"Under price it is good phone, but I would like to share some disadvantages which I have noticed is that, its network performance is very low and somewhere battery does not also provide good performance and overall I would say try something else instead of this one.."

"Except Camera everything is perfect, in the budget friendly phone from one olus"
"After using it for 27 days.1. The network is not stable, it always shifts from 5G to 4G and the internet stops working.2. Only the look is good nothing else.3. Battery backup is good.4. Important network connectivity is very bad."
Nice Look and good Quality
"All over good product ,nice photography best  looking  nice battery backup but not completely compact mobile comparison to moto g84 at this range"
"The device doesn't justify its cost.Camera: Camera quality is ok not so great.Battery: As a 55000mAh battery, the battery backup is really good. It's been easily last 2 days in 1 full charge.Display: Display panel doesn't look amoled display, color and contrast looks like ips panel.Design: Phone design is very good.Performance: Performance is good, just 1 cons is a very aged chipset.It should be below 15k."
Look and features are nice
Very very Nice phone
So elegant oneplus ce4 lite 5g
Very good phoneAnd very good performanceVery good battry backupVery good camera
Phone is nice! you can go for it! I'll update my review after use of 1 month
"Amazing product with reasonable budgetCamera quality is goodProcessor , display all goods"
Camera quality : very goodCharging speed : veri fastFingerprint reader :very quicklyValue for moneyI am getting 5 star
It is just an ok ok phone. I have been using OnePlus for the last 2 years but this phone disappointed me a little bit. The brightness of the display is  little lower as compared to my previous phone. Battery life is great. Its UI is similar to the usual of OnePlus. The camera is also not great but at a decent level. Overall I gave 3 stars to this phone. It doesn't match my expectation level. I will suggest going for OnePlus Nord 3 in this price range.
It's very good phone if you want a good camera quality and also design look and performance
Camera quality is not good 20 k
"Best camera, battery backup, fast charging and smooth gaming very nice performance"
I was much exited to use oneplus phone and buy this phone after a lot of comparison. But this mobile 5500 MAH battery has disappointed me..Rest phone is ok..
Phone is good but that camera is not good
"Camera , display and all features are too good and worth it having it ."
Excellent 10/10
Nice one worth money
I really love it.. this cemra 50 mp n other cemra 200 mp same picture. So I am recommend 1plus is better
Everything is decent but it only record max at 1080 and 30fps from main back camera
No quality mobile
If ONE PLUS increase battery capacity atleast upto 6000mah it will be a great phone
This product is very nice good battery good camera
Good and greatful

"Need to charge a two times in 24hrs, camera quality is not good."
"Preused Phone. Never buy electronics from this FlipCart. Even after letting them know that it is a used phone, they are making me loiter here and there to escalate my case. Not thinking about Customer.phone order on 23rd April 2025 but it is found that phone is activated already by somebody else on 16th April 2025. The delivery guy will open the seal in front of you as if it is new. Be aware."
"Though the processor is old compare to other devices. I am an average phone user. I looked for only specific specifications. And I liked among them are1. 5500 mah battery, lasts upto 36 hours2. Charging adapter, which doesn't have others.3. Clean UI4. Good display5. Headphone jack pointAdditionally, the one which amazed me is the dual speaker. It is quite loud and crisp.Good budget phone. I got it in around 16k."

"I've been using the phone for almost a month now and so far have no complaints. It has good battery life, is lightweight, and functions smoothly. The camera takes good pictures even when not using the 108MP lens. Of course, the 108MP lens gives the best pictures, but one has to switch over to the high-definition lens in order to use it."

One of the best phone under 28k
Initially I was a  little sceptical. But I loved it. Camera is good and no green line
"This phone is beautiful.It has thin basel,good design,good display,best performance,and better than average camera,battery lasting for more than 1 day.Overall this phone is good for all-rounder usage."
the OnePlus Nord 4 is an excellent mid-range phone offering flagship-like features at a very competitive price. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a feature-packed device in this price range!
"I don't know why but battery department is decent...but I hear a lot abt this phone sot.Kinda disappointed Abt the battery.Also the camera is avg.Display, performance, design, haptic feedback is great."
Primary camera osm... battery  is average8 hours continuous only
Best in the range still now I purchased in 6 months ago I am satisfied with the seal still don't think any phone under this range with this quality and stability which lacks in this price ran
Fantabulous smartphone camera is perfect speakers are top notch processor is amazing and charging speed is just wowwwww an abouslute steal in this price range
"All okay , price high"
Fabulous!
"One Plus Nord 4 is a device that give you good performance, great design and a average camera, battery is better but most importantly it comes with a complete metal unibody design with glass arround camera. Go for it"
Totally worth itReally good in performanceCamera is also decentBattery is also goodOverall good at this Price point
Everything was top notch at this price point ..one thing found slightly disappointing which was sound ..I had Nord 2 which had better sound output but still this is a good purchase as we mostly prefer earphones for songs or movies . Highly recommended
"I had a dream of buying a OnePlus phone, it is complete and the phone runs well, it runs at 90fps on Android"
Good phone and Performance Like flashipkiller Good phone value for money
Camera quality Awesome
"Loved the mobile, Osm experience with flipkart."
Very nice phone with Best performanceFront camera ok ok ....
Good to use smooth to use good os update
It's an amazing phone with all things above my expectations camera low light conditions video recording all is best it's a light weight phone. My favourite parts is it's AI it's work amazing
"Bestest phone In this range, this phone is Allrounder and I like this so much, i personally suggest you to buy this phone because you feel batter with this phone."
"I have migrated from Realme Narzo 30 to OnePlus Nord 4. I have been using this phone for the last 4 to 5 days. Overall, the experience has been good so far. The operating experience is excellent compared to my previous phone, and the charging speed is incredibly fast. These are the features I like the most about this phone. The camera is okay."
Nice  and good look and fentastic performance.
"Camera may would have been better, particularly the front one otherwise, it is a great product."
I got a good mobile and thanks to flipkart
"Disign superb, camera not good, battery nice, performance good but IR bluster limited, You need to download extra remote third party app. Without internet AI not working.Ai eraser etc"
Under 30000 best performance phone_
You can go for it except camera.
I love the battery backup most..
Nice phone and camera quality is awesome
"A very solid Oneplus product. Love the design, metal uni body.7 plus Gen 3 is very capable of most games, runs all games smoothly at stable frame rates.The Oxygen OS is very stable and smooth, absolutely great battery life.Combined with LPDDR5X ram and USF 4.O storage, it's a very smooth phone."
Good quality but charging time heating mobile
Best smartphone in this price range. The performance is average .It has a good battery life and also the UI and user experience of the software is very good. The build quality of the phone is same as of a flagship phone . The camera is not very good
Best of oneplus go for it I updated all the updates at one go no issues just loves it really beast at 25k
Nice and superbNothing to say anything
Its very amazing in camera and gaming
"Good product you can go with it, got this at 26k. The charger is very fast and the performance is very strong, The UI is very smooth. In hand feel is also good. Overall very good. Don't expect too much from the camera, it's good in the price range, yet manage the skin and the final image looks good, camera has not problem. I liked it's performance, UI and in hand feel that matters the most"
All Rounder Phone Under This budget
PERFECT MOBILE UNDER 30KCAMERA AND MOBILE LOOK OSAMMOBILE PROSESOR GOOD WORKOVEROLL BETTER MOBILE IN THIS SEGMENT
"There are Some Better Options For the Camera Quality like Nothing, Moto but I Preferred this because of different design, to Experience Oxygen Os nd mainly Performance...nd Absolutely Software Experience is, Performance , Battery ( not too good but ok after April Update 7-8 hours of simple use) and yeh what it is..But still after may 2025 i will not recommend this because it was launched an year ago"

Light weight phone. Camera and sound is fine and performance is highly appreciable.
SuperGood Product
Everything lovelyJust for the first time u wont feel much difference b/w pro and non pro model iphones.
"Coming from an iPhone 11, the upgrade is not completely unnecessary. I can see few daily improvements which impacts me personally. The battery back up is a good upgrade. The cameras are obviously better. The Dynamic Island is alright but not something I cannot live without. Face ID works smoother.I am not into games, so no comments on that. For a regular person, this phone is more than enough. And for people with other Apple devices, this is just an awesome part of the ecosystem."
Love the performance
Great experience
I order smartphone from Flipkart. This is my 4th phone i order. I have had the best experience every time.
Performance super

Coming from iphone 12 mini.Camera is definitely a upgrade over the previous generation.Design outside remains the same. Pastel colours with matte finish.The Dynamic Island is what i liked for the notification part.Processor of previous generation pro models.Overall a value for money among the 15 models.Got it a great deal in flipkart clubbing exchange and bank offers.Delivery was on time.
Mobile battery consumption very fastSo that I charge 3 times to charge in a day
I upgraded from iPhone 13 to 15 and this phone is awesome worth the money go for it

"My Experience from January to till date was awesome, it gives you best performance in any features than other iPhones."
Nice Colour
Design and performance is good. But somehow I felt the quality and standard is not the same as it used to be. It does heat up while charging and prolonged usage. This is unexpected and unacceptable. Also there are connectivity issues with Apple CarPlay.
Nice productBest phone
A fantastic product.I was an iPhone 13 user I have upgraded to this. Brilliant display. I can see a great difference in battery backup. I can also say that the Dynamic Island helps in UI to the users. Looks premium. Price range might drop in a year.Thanks for Flipkart sale days.
I just loved it Thank you so much

Marvellous camera. Light weight. Perfect handy.Used every pro version before 15.But trust me . I personally feel this 15 is at par with its pro version camera .

Gud product
Good product (value for money) terms are not suitable for this type of product because a huge amount for any middle class Indian tex payer person
Battery lasted longer than my first relationship (4days). Listening to arijit singh songs on full volume since then still isn't getting over. Has more warmth than her. Unlike her there's two way communication here as touchpad is very responsive . Fingerprint unlock is nice as it only opens up to me. 5 Star for this -1 for Shivanshi
The photos clicked with the mobile just seems awesome and lively!!
Good over
Firstly I worried that Flipkart send duplicate or refurbished iPhone but I am wrong great shopping experience genuine product at reasonable price max discount rather than other online or offline platforms great deal with Flipkart I am impressed and obviously great product from Apple

This is undoubtedly the best in the market! Feels premium and also the performance is at par excellence! A beast in terms of camera quality and battery backup!
Why the apple does not work on battery backupIts really worst. according to price battery backup is very bad you need to charge 2 times for a days.Even 6k 7k price phone gives awesome battery life.
Its good but its bad in battery  condition and its has heating issue.This mobile is not for heavy mobile user likeThis is ok for professional person.This is for avarage mobile userWho have this mindset (brand and society remarks are important )So go for Otherwise there are lot of mobiles available with adavance thecnology and with comfortable and better user interface

Charging takes too much time2. 60hz display although once you get used to its not much of an issue3. Some times phone gets hot
A very good product and also loved it
Probably best phone to buy under 53kOverall good balanced phoneBeing a ios device it'll never give you the fun of an Android device. Buy only if you want it for professional reasons
Battery only drain fastBattery health 98 at two monthBut worth
Design The iPhone 15 has a satin-finished design and a durable glass panel on the front.Dynamic Island The Dynamic Island helps with multitasking.IP68 ingress protection The iPhone 15 can withstand being submerged in up to 6 meters of fresh water for 30 minutes.Stereo speakers The iPhone 15's stereo speakers are loud and have good sound quality. The battery life is lower than expected draining very fast and as usual heating issues there.
Everything is awesome! Great phone..

"Initially I missed 120 Hz screen refresh rate after switching from Mi 11x pro to iphone15. It been a month using iPhone 15, accordingly to my experience, unless you want to purchase more apple products like Mac book, apple watch etc. it is not smart decision to buy iphone. But I surely appreciated it's small form factor and less weight. Battery backup is also good."
Awesome product and received an original product
Awestruck by its performance
Far better than 15pro no finger print even with moisturize hands
Amazing Just go and buy it blindly if you have enough of money
"Phone is good built lightweight,handy, camera good quality, display great phone is nice if love it's OS and can spend that much"
"Phone is good but if u already have an iPhone 12,13,14 then it's not worth upgrading, same design and similar performance except dynamic Island which I guarantee you will ever notice or use"
I phone is phone nothing but it's a brand that makes the cost. Better should be more improved. And it gives heat.
Product is good. But worst delivery experience
Overall performance is best.Good aesthetic and nice color. Only thing worries me that it gets really hot with increase of brightness and during 15 min video call..
Phone is great.

"The only thing I like about this phone is the camera quality and that is the reason I bought this phone.I already have an Android phone which is less than 50% of its price and still is better in every aspect except the camera.Well! Definitely, iphone 15 has a flagship level chipset but I am not a gamer and a normal user and I find mid rangers and flagship all perform at similar level in daily tasks.While iphone 15 only has 60hz screen which feels choppy, all other phones have 120-144hz scr...READ MORE"

"I am an iphone user since long. I have bought this YELLOW colour. But really feel that apple should rethink and rename this colour as GOLDEN YELLOW, its edges are slightly on the Golden side as you can see in the pics. Additional feature as compare to iphone 13, this has Dynamic Island and camera is superb  I am using it for 5 hrs daily, not facing any heating issue as such."
"I have moved from android to ios, iphone 15 is really a good device, fulfills all the basic things that needed at daily lifeJust a note for the battery consumption, it drains a bit fast"
Camera is best quality
"I recently purchased the iPhone 15 from Flipkart, and I'm thrilled with my experience. The sleek design and vibrant display are stunning, and the performance is top-notch with its powerful A16 Bionic chip. The camera quality is exceptional, capturing detailed and vivid photos even in low light. Battery life has been impressive, easily lasting a full day with heavy use. Flipkart's delivery was prompt, and the packaging was secure. Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase and would hig...READ MORE"
"Upgraded from Iphone 11. worth buying it. here are some pros and cons.Pros:1) Smooth, constant software update,2)6 GB RAM,1 day easily sustainable battery life3) extremely helpful if you are in apple ecosystem.4) 48MP camera is really great if we compare  with my I Phone 11's 12 MP .Best video quality.5) don't go for 15 plus or pro model even if you have enough money. but 128 GB base model within 65000 RS and use that extra money to buy MacBook AIR or airpod 3rd GEN.CONS:1) 60HZ disp...READ MORE"
All good in this n camera superb
Excellent purchase battery life is good for medium usage but can get you through the whole day on single charge. Am just loving this phone
Amazing Camera and battery
The product is good.Prize is excessive due to Apple branding only. Battery backup is not up to expectations. Flagship Titanium is lacking in it which is available in pro models only. At this price the screen should have been 6.8 inches at least.
I can say the 60hz doesn't feel 60hz it is very smooth and may be because of appleI was too worried about the 60 hz because I was switching from 120hz Android (realme GT master edition) to this one but after using iphone 15 I feel lags in my android 120hzBut I feel camera quality is avg but videography is next levelLove the speakerQuality of display is just wowCharging is also quite good and battery backup is also awesomeI am getting 5-6 hr gameplay(free fire+bgmi) from 100% to 25% qui...READ MORE

Awesome.Camera too goodDisplay too goodBattery GoodFeels too good
Look and design very nice
Love iphone 15
"Well, there is a little bit of hitting issue there, not at charging but in general operations. From design perspective, dynamic island is horribly thick for a 6.1 screen. It could have been smarter if the look was a little bit slim. What stops apple to increase the battery capacity now a days is beyond explanation. The Chinese manufacturers has definitely done a phenomenal job in terms of both the battery and charging. There's no trade Off there, it's a success for them. In software, the comp...READ MORE"
"Perfect one to upgradeEdit after 7 months : No diappointments , build quality good as this has undergone few hard falls . Underwater also good . Camera quality is awesome . Battery is always a issue but it is okay for a person uses 5-6 hours daily . Videos are also good in cinematic mode . Good update i bought it at 78k when launched . But Around 65 it is super deal to do at this time ."
Almost  good but the battery is overheating i don't know why and it drained very quickly this is the one of the major issues in this phone otherwise all ok but not satisfied with the battery
Amazing phone ButNow days Chapri people Drop apple's brand value.
Very nice phone im happy very good
Amazing. This is my second iphone after 11 pro.Used it for 3 days till now. No heating issue. While setting up the device/updating ios/transferring data - it didn't heat at all. Smooth experience. Best buy for 2024.
Pros:1. Incredibly smart device this year2. iOS interface3. Data Privacy4. Premium build quality5. Dynamic Island6. Ecosystem benefits if you own other Apple devices7. Powerful processorCons:1. 60Hz refresh rate for a flagship (although not very noticeable)2. No improvements to Siri3. Expensive4. Low possibility of repair
Black colour is just awesome
Everything is good. Battery backup is hardly 6hrs will come while continuously usage. Camera is fantastic. In this iphone 60 hz refreshing rate is equals to 120hz refresh rate in android. Very light weight.
"A Mixed Bag of BrillianceThe iPhone 15 flaunts an impressive camera setup, capturing moments with exceptional clarity and detail. However, users may encounter heating issues post 80% charge, which could disrupt prolonged usage. Occasionally, screen touch glitches may hamper the otherwise seamless user experience. Despite these setbacks, the iPhone 15 excels in performance and features. The standout Dynamic Island feature enhances productivity and personalization. Overall, the iPhone 15 is a...READ MORE"

Kidney to gyaOne kidney for i phoneAnd one for i phone accessories
Awesomeness Cellphone. This is my first IOS and the experience is fantastic I am loving it. The videography is to next level. Very Happy.
Good one!
I am very happy with the sevice of Flipkart and  product was very good.thanks Flipkart
"All is well, but battery health is draining very fast."
"Perfect upgrade from 13.. An incredible device that delivers everything I could want. The design is sleek and lightweight, with the new Dynamic Island feature. The camera is a standout, photos and videos look professional with excellent low-light performance and vibrant colors.The A16 Bionic chip ensures lightning-fast performance, whether I'm gaming, editing videos, or running multiple apps. Battery life is also impressive, easily lasting a full day with moderate use."
Best iPhone upgrade after the iPhone 14. I got this in Big Billion Day Sale for 53k. I'm reviewing this phone after 3 months.The Camera and display quality is amazing. But I switched from a 120 Hz display android phone so it took me a while to adapt to this one.But looking at a overall scenario it is a decent phone with clean UI. I've been liking iOS now and will definitely upgrade to iOS in future.The battery is not upto the mark but it does the job pretty well.I liked the automations an...READ MORE
All and all a beast!!!The only thing which can be improved is battery
Recently bought this phone and realized why Apple make the best phones in the world.One of the most beautiful purchase I ever made
"Mashallah Great phone, last time braught  IPhone 12 for face unlock with mask, this is worth upgrade planning to keep at least 3 years, thank you team flipkart for great offer"
"The iPhone 15 is simply amazing! The design is sleek, and the slightly curved edges make it feel great in the hand. The display is bright, sharp, and stunning, everything looks fantastic on it, whether watching videos or scrolling through photos. The camera upgrades are noticeable, especially in low light, and impressed by the level of detail in every shot.Performance is super smooth, with no lag even when running multiple apps."
Thanks to flipkart service nice open box delivery.IPhone 15 performance is great and so smooth.
"At the time of sale it was the best deal for me , intented to buy pixel 8 but went for iphone 15 was really worth it . Performance user experience camera design is undoubtedly excellent the only drawback is the battery life , which sustains for only 6 7 hours and in daily life have to charge 2 times . As a flagship phone it could be a better but noting is perfect, without the battery issue in every aspect it is value for money."
Great product and I would really recommend this device to anyone who wants to use a phone for a long time if Apple is making an expensive product then they will deliver a quality. I have been using the apple devices since 2009 till now. Awesome experience thanks to Apple.
"In 51500, it's the best option"

Excellent!
I have used iPhone for 20 days already and it was a great experience with Flipkart including purchase of iPhone with replacement of old phone was pretty smooth. The phone is awesome and since its iPhone it doesn't require any review.
Awesome Deal!!! Best camera!!!
Excellent Device.... Camera (PORTRAIT) NEXT LEVELPerformance Battery I just loved it WORTH IT
"Awesome phone, camera, build, battery lasts 1 day easily, overall met my expectations"
Amazing Camera and Nice Colour...
"It is the best iPhone that I have ever seen after iPhone 13, Its camera quality is so amazing. Especially, HIEF MAX mode. Its bes iPhone after 15 pro."
"Awesome As a first time ios user, I literally think it's one of the best deal!Nonetheless as Android-flagship becoming more expensive these days, still ios doesn't match the fluidity provided by Android. One very promising I've seen so far using iPhone is that battery last longer than i expected with high security. It's like pay per view authenticity one can appreciate using iPhone. If you can match the trend set in ios you may go for it but if you don't stick with your android. People m...READ MORE"
"I am very happy to buy it because its camera is very good and its performance is also very good, its features are also very good and will never make you bored."
"Bought 256gb green variant ,new to iosIOS is very fluid and smoothDesign is awesome, i took green its looking better in hand than other colours and dynmaic island adds to it.No heatings issuesPerfromance is goodCharges faster than pixelCamera and Video recording is very goodComing from pixel 7a where pixel is one of worst device out there having bad charging, worst battery backup even heats up in normal usage in our country."
Worth every penny .. Confused between pixel and iPhone but no regrets to buy an iPhone
"Bought it from flipkart, as I was getting the best price here!"
"The best in class iphone. Many people may mock iPhone, but everyone have to accept that iPhone has the best in class features and technology. It is obviously not fair to compare iPhone and android because each have its own pros and cons. Seeing the features that iPhone provide at this price point is really of premium level and I am pretty sure you are gonna enjoy using this awesome device.Speaking about specs, iPhone 15 has the best camera till date, the best display, awesome battery managem...READ MORE"
"I appreciate that the iPhone 15 has turned its weakest aspect, the dynamic range, into one of its strongest features. However, the 60 Hz display bothers me daily. It's not that a 60 Hz display is inherently bad, but after spending so much on a phone in 2024, not getting a smooth display experience is disappointing. This makes it the most expensive phone with a 60 Hz display. Apart from that, everything else is superb."
Camera quality is superb and battery backup also.
"Awesome phone, thanks to Flipkart for quick delivery. This is my 1st iOS experience so very excited ."
The person to whom it's gifted says that everything is  great. Hope it was a little cheaper and more affordable.
I love the product  and the delivery person also and adding camera photos
Camera and display both are good
Very Fabulous
iPhone 15 shotsNice average camera quality and good quality displayProfanation are incredible but 60 Hz only
Best I phone 15
Camera quality Superb
Very good deal and fastest delivery in next day.
Very nice phone the camera was too good I luv it
It's good to be transfer iphone 11 to 15 and best experience ever.
The camera is so beautiful and it takes good pics in portrait mode here are some sample pics
"Just take it without asking anyone,"
Camera is a major upgrade over previous models. If you have 12 or older you can upgrade to 15 without thinking
"Back to iPhone family from android, best upgrade phone. Fully satisfied with the design and the performance. Minimum 10hrs of battery on single charge (12hrs in low power mode). No lags and even it charges very fast up to 80% which is decent."
"Great phone , worth the money"
"BEST camera and performance,"
Absolutely Amazing!Premium matte body!
Just wowBuy it now
Best phone nice camera and performance
"Very BAD experience I'm extremely disappointed with my iOS experience after switching from Android. While the camera and display are outstanding, performance issues overshadowed these positives. Within two days, I encountered severe battery drain (only 4-5 hours) and overheating. Worse, the phone lags and becomes unbearably hot. These issues mar an otherwise great device."
Battery Health Dropped to 85% in 6 months. Rest everything is ok.
Damn good
"While iPhones are superior to other brands, the battery life can be disappointing for heavy user, and the display size isn't the best for gaming.Nevertheless, they're worth buying."
Apple should give charger with every device
Superb in performance but the battery backup is soo poor at 70k
Everything is good but battery drops in a half day it means you need to charge 2 times in a day. Battery drops very fast. Apple should improve battery performance.
All is good but hit too much so don't ignore
"The phone is pretty good in terms of camera.  However, those who have used 120hz premium display phones will find the display experience to be bad."
Iphones are always bestDual sim feature should also come
Best in the budget
Picture quality was awesome.
The only hitting issue is there. If that will resolve then this phone will be the masterpiece.
Awesome must buy it I m really happy with iPhone 15
Battery is a little concern
Awesome pics by iphone 15. Love it
Much faster and best camera only issue of battery one day easily use after full charge. Design Awesome .best color in images and 4K with 60 fps is awesome.
Apple as usual. Eco system is great. Rest all are average for the price but I paid for the ecosystem
Heating issue but overall good phone
"Actually phone is very good this is my first iPhone i found heating at back panel at normal usage also, it should be fixed asap because giving 80k for premium feel and still not feels worthy after heating, it gains heat very fast and cools down too but due to heat battery drop is very fast ."
Nice product but the heating issue n battery can be improved
Photo Quality is Excellent But Battery performance and Heat issue
"A great phone with quality display 60Hz, average to good battery backup, speaker same as 14, camera is very good in this segment, performance toooo good for this compact sized phone almost never heated much except for charging and bgmi though normal for every phone. Dynamic island animations are great though not a fan of it still better than notch. And design is amazing very premium."
"Nice camera first of all then battery is also very decent although the Mah is low but the optimisation of phone is very good with the battery so handy and classy ,also the calling quality and speakers are too good."
Awesome buy
"When compared to android in similar burget, I phone is better only in securityNothing else is better"
Device is getting too hot. It's looking like you have the burning stick.
Camera very hard but phone heating
"I'm very excited to this, Apple iPhone 15And this is my first Apple devices!Value for money TQ so much for your valuable cooperation FlipkartDelivery within 24 hrs only"
Nice camara
Everything is fine but it's heating while using phone
"Mind-blowingI love itEverything is greatttVery good battery backup, best camera, very good design.Update after using for 1 week:I legit have to charge my phone for 2times in a day else everything is great"
A great upgrade from iPhone 11..The battery backup is great it is even better than iPhone 15pro which is obvious due to the proMotion 120hz display..Yes you'll feel the absence of 120hz but it doesn't matters that much until you play games yes you won't get 90fps on bgmi but yes still you can play games without any hesitation everyone mostly knows that and yes 60fps is enough coz our eyes can fully utilise the 60fps Higher fps are just eye pleasing..So It is not a big deal..Camera performance...READ MORE

My dream comes true
Very powerful phone. Camera is extremely good if one can adjust the settings. Battery backup is awesome. Design is handy. Features are cool. Price is reasonable.
Good and super performance loved it but not happy with the delivery its been late for 2days rest all went good n awesome product
"Nothing to say..(Camera, performance, display, design, battey service )Everything is Perfect"
"As always, Apple doing its job perfectly! Superb Phone!"
"Overall: The iPhone 15 is a fantastic phone for everyday use, it offers a compelling blend of performance, camera prowess (no doubt the best camera), and battery life (as per my use it is easily lasting 1 full day). However, the lack of a high refresh rate display and the underwhelming charging speed hold it back from being truly exceptional.Pros:Superb Cameras: The 48MP main sensor captures stunning photos with excellent detail and dynamic range. Low-light performance is also impressive. ...READ MORE"
"Very good experience, highly recommended for upgrade"
Over hyped. Not as good as android. Not suggested. Only brand name.
Writing this review after using it for a month.Display - 4.5/5Performance - 5/5Camera - 4.5/5 ( camera settings would help a lot with improving camera quality)Battery - 3/5 drains very earlyAnd sometimes there is lil heating issue
The divice is very heating problem
"Guys dont listen to negative reviews about 60hz display and batter heating issues. ios makes you forget that you are using a 60hz display cuz its much better than a 90hz or 120hz display in android. zero bugs, amazing user interface, best camera in class. after using oneplus, samsung, redmi, realme, infinix and oppo for the past 10 years, finally am realising why people hype iphones. truly amazing experience."
Just Awesome - Was bit skeptical about 60Hz but it feels extremely smooth.- No heating issues at all.- Camera quality is also good.- Overall nice upgrade for me after using poco f1 for half a decade.I would definitely recommend it. Just go for it you wont regret.
"It ticks all the basic boxes well as expected. But had a lot of expectations from the camera as it was one of the primary reasons for buying iPhone. I can tell you - just go with a Samsung if you want to click photos without thinking too much.The iPhone's camera is not good for Indian human subjects with darker skin tones. It over-processes the image way too much and makes you look much darker than you are. Not just human subjects, it overprocesses everything. The final image looks very dif...READ MORE"
Very Best baseline iPhone ever. even if you have a iphone 14 it is still a upgrade. the new frosted glass and rounded edges make it premium feel. camera is just awesome. better than 14 pro camera. battery is just like iphone 14. type c is also a welcome with braided data cabel. just blue colour looks a lot like white.
"Pros:Battery LifeThermal managementBody designRAM ManagementCons:iOS - Unpractical, too buggy and least automated"
The products are good but Flipkart services are  very third class and exchange services are very third class and they didn't have knowledge for exchanging the product .
Smooth

Android is better than ios
"High quality cameraThe iPhone 15 has a new 48-megapixel main camera. The new camera sensor is larger than the one in the iPhone 14, and it has better low-light performance. The iPhone 15 also has a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera and a new 12-megapixel telephoto camera."
Not justifying the price .. bit disappointed about the  display (refresh rate should be high).. no differences between 12 and 15 except brightness .. those who willing to upgrade plz be ok with your 13 .. there is very low difference in day to day life use..but the Dynamic Island is awesome it is way better than expected..
"AFTER ONE WEEK OVERALL PERFOMANCE IS GOOD BUT  FEW APPLE MUST IMPROVE 1. Design very Round on Corner gives a feel of baby Toy, 2. Some thing must improve in iOS 17 its very Classic in this mordern era like Auto Rotate not possible on photos you will have to go home select rotate lock etc."
Timely fast delivery by flipcart.Product wise it was just superb ... new design with matt finish and the camaras are just outstanding .
I am so happy....
Loving it!!! Delivery was quick .
Looking Like Monster

"The best iphone to buy right now. Chose the 512 gb variant. It has type c, great battery life and overall great size as well. Thought of getting the plus but it was too big. But that does have good battery life. But this one has a great battery life even with a small battery. Also no words to say about camera and performance. Great absolutely beautiful. I went for the 512 gb storage because this uses more space for photos with the new 48 mp camera. Iphone should really make the base variant a...READ MORE"
If You are having Iphone 13/14. This upgrade may seem illogical. Rest everything is fine. Yet laving some lag issues while typing.
"The best iphone till so far. Magnificent look and feel.I bought the 15 one and it's so compact and feels so good in hand.One major feature of this phone is the amazing dynamic island and it's animations.Go with it, you'll find your money spent well."
"Amazing phone overall, camera is good even in low light, telephoto camera is quite unique to get more closer photos without loosing quality, display as always amazing, but bas model 60 hz gotta comprise with that and last not least around 7 8 hrs with medium usage battery life."
I am so happy

Value for Money Product...
As good as apple previous models
Been using since almost a year now and the phone is superior in all aspects compared to all the past android phones i hv used. Its more intuitive in all its features. Love the dynamic island as well. Camera is superb (as expected). Haptics and speakers are still top class after a year of usage.
One time investment. Go for it
I love the performance and camera of this. And for a etter experience I would suggest to  give a better battery performance. That's it.
Amazing product. Best phone for me.. Only heating issue problem while charging and while using camera 4K video in sunlight. Go with plus model if you want more battery life..
All is good but some heating problems  in phone

Everything is top notch. What to say about iPhone that has not already been said. Camera is exceptional.

"This is the first time trying iPhone, someone like me who is used to android with high battery capacity, this phones battery seems to drain quickly to me. Its camera perform really awesome in day time however sometimes it performs poorly in low light. But video is really awesome in all conditions. I will re write the review after a long term use."

This is my third iPhone mobile and this is the best experience so far with the non-pro model. Everything is good but I was expecting a 90Hz refresh rate display in iPhone 15

Love this product.
Awesomely wonderful...no words to explain with affordable price
"There is nothing to say more about this phone. I would just advise to understand your needs. You will get fewer customizable options, less flexibility etc. You have to be familiar with it if you are an Android user."
"Bought it in January...Have used it for the past 6 months and the experience is nothing short of amazing...Best in class camera which can literally take social media ready photos in any given environment... Color balancing, dynamic range, focus adjustment and almost all the parameter are spot on in every shot"
Awsome mobile

Camera quality Super
Its was genuine fully satisfied with the product I always order iphones from flipkart only
Best compact phone for long term.
This is my first iPhone. Experience is very good as of now. For me I have to work with excel and word most of the time and there is no MS office because iPhone has its own version of Office which is a bit different.Camera and battery both are good. Look is so premium.
Only one without adequate product knowledge can be unhappy with Apple products.  Expensive but outstanding product.
U all know about iPhone 15 so am very impressed with blue colour damn beautiful
"Though there is a slight heating issue at times especially while charging, the performance, battery backup and camera quality is outstanding. Would definitely recommend the phone."
thanks Flipkart
Yes there are some issues in heating but it is definatley a excellent product as well as one very much important thing too add that you would absoulutely get orignal product from flipkart no need to worry about that and the seller is also geniune.
"I recently upgraded to the iPhone 15, and I am thoroughly impressed with its performance and features. Here are some highlights from my experience:#Design and Display:The iPhone 15 continues Apple's tradition of sleek and premium design. The new ceramic shield front cover provides extra durability, and the edge-to-edge OLED display is simply stunning. The colors are vibrant, and the brightness levels are perfect for outdoor use.# Performance:Powered by the A16 Bionic chip, the iPhone 15...READ MORE"

better camera than iphone 14 progood battery backupand dynamic island is very useful
"1. It is the best phone and worth every rupee in terms of its user interface, unique eco system, siri and some other options  which can be copied by other manufacturers but cant replicate (if incase a person thinks iphones are bit overpriced - they are pricing for their unique features)2. In terms of camera, display, performance and in every other aspect it gives best output.3. In terms of this iPhone 15 series, the upgrade in this series is of leaps and bounds compared to other upgrades ...READ MORE"

"The innovative new design features back glass that has color infused throughout the material. A custom dual ion-exchange process for the glass, and an aerospace-grade aluminum enclosure, help make iPhone 15 incredibly durable. Dependably durable."
Money worth it
Good Performance.
Super excited
Genuine product received.. the product is awesome.. no need to tell its worthiness because it is from Apple Inc.Thanks flipkart for prompt delivery
The Experience with new features is Amazing . Definately iphone 15 is better than 13 or 14 .
Good photo sutu
Long time android user. Thought of giving iOS a try.And now I understand why apple is apple. The highlight is the interaction between the hardware and the software.Android feels clunky in front of iOS. (Have used all Android skins and currently on s24+)
Android to direct iPhone 15 awesome experience.
Best all-rounder flagship level camera
"Awesome switch from android to IOS ,just loving it"
It can be more better if display refresh rate has 120hz
Love it so much
Honest review after using it for a month! Best phone of apple so far camera battery performance are on top notch!
Portrait mode is TOO GOOD
Pwoli item
Great product again from apple.Worthy upgrade from iPhone 14. Dynamic Island is great. Battery easily last for a day.. Happy with the product.
Go for without hesitation
Camera quality is quite good.  The battery lasts a little less.  Well the phone is overall good.
This phone has comfy feel
amazing product
Nice phone iam happy
Pros of iPhone 15:1. Best camera in the segment (improved photo and video quality).2. Powerful performance.3. Dynamic island gives it a better look than the previous iphone 14.4. Comes up with Type-C port (but only 2.0).Cons of iPhone 15:1. Battery could have been better.2. Slow charging speed.3. 2.0 Type C gives slow transfer speeds when compared to 3.14. Apple is still stuck with 60hz display when others are offering 120hz in a very less price tag!
The experience of apple iphone 15 is feel by you when it is used by you without using it no one could say anythingAmazing experience with this apple phone full fast and smooth
"Nice product,,and delivery is awesome"

Top performing  mobile
Best inclass .  Should have been little smaller.
Very good camera quality and performance
Amazing design quality and I love this iPhone
Apple phones are known for quality and reliability. I exchanged my 1 phone 13 and migrated to 15 it's superb.Flipkart delivery was slightly dis comfort since delayed 4 days
"iPhone is always the best in every quality category. Earlier, there were battery backup issues, but I am getting more than a day of battery backup. The island display in the basic model is really exciting, which was earlier in the Pro model only. I recommend you guys to go for it without any thought, if you don't require a high refresh rate display."
Fast Reliable Beautiful
Product was genuine and great.
Iam happy
My first iphone switch and i love it!!!
Everything is good i got it at65 best deal so far i get  from flipkart

"48 MP upgrade in camera, matches the Indian Tone , display is now very bright, love the matte finish, 60 Hz display is a downside, when power gets low in my power bank it starts charging the powerbank."

This phone is wow
"It is very fast, buttery touch interaction and intuitive software. Great phone again from Apple."

"Awesome phone,*Camera is excellent*Battery backup is superb just like an Android phone*Performance is brilliantI phone 15 is best phone"
Nice phone speakers display and camera quality amazing
"I upgraded because of the band that is 5G and a better camera , look wise it is good and weight is comfortable to carry. Dynamic Island if catchy to eye. It keeps the Apple standard, gels well with Apple ecosystem like AirPods , iwatch, mac . Though a little pricey at this point but one may wait for or some sort of discount offers."
thanks iphone good
Most value for money iPhone ever.
The product is premium and there is no doubt about that. However the battery life could have been better. The battery drains pretty fast
Overall purchased a good phone for my day to day usage
Amazing phone just no words to say...just one complaint that some features are easy on Android but in ios its takes more time to do it...
Grt performance
Decent phone but battery could be better.
Awesome iPhone its just feels like prothe camera is awesome portrait mode is just like dslrDynamic island is also next level
Nice phone loved it.Camera 5Battery 4Design 5
"I was sceptical at first about moving form an android to ios. I was confused between s23 and ip15 but i bought this phone and i must say i am very happy about it. I have not faced any issues in this device since I have been using it, no heating while gaming, charges quickly, and believe me if you have been using 60hz panel before this you will not have any problems but coming from a 120hz panel you might need some time adjusting to it. All in all this has got to be the best phone under 70k ca...READ MORE"
"Except the 60Hz display, but if you buy a I phone 15 model then it is not even detectable, everything is top class whether it is the camera, performance or battery, the battery lasts for a day, and Dynamic Island is my favorite."
Awesome pictures
Fully satisfied with the product
Good experience I am using first time apple  mobile
This iPhone is one of the best non pro iPhones of all time.

Top class performance in every aspect

First iOS upgrade of my life...Loved it's many features as
Pros:1. Video Recording2. DisplayCons:1. Battery2. Colour and back panel
"So, I traded a kidney for the iPhone 15, and now I am homeless, but at least I can take gorgeous selfies under the stars! The camera is so sharp, it captured the moment my bank account decided to ghost me. The display is so vibrant, I can see the cosmos while lying on the sidewalk. And hey, at least with the iPhone 15, the photos of your kidney surgery will look amazing. I can see my future self asking, Was this really worth an organ? Spoiler alert: YES.Sure, I miss my kidney sometimes,...READ MORE"
"Enjoying the product to the fullest. The dynamic island and type-C port make this more user friendly.Build quality and looks are also very good.Despite 60 fps display,it is so smooth to operate.Video quality is just next level.The only issue is that the battery drains slightly faster than expected and the phone gets a little heated while charging."
"Great phone. Have been using it for the past 5 months. No performance issue. The main point of my purchase was the camera, which didn't disappoint me. If you are someone who wants to start content creating, you can go for this phone for sure. Battery performance is good too, it gives upto 1day battery backup on normal usage. If you play games on it like Bgmi, Codm etc, it would give a backup of 4hrs. I think it is sufficient for someone who likes mobile gaming."
Green colour is so elegant so beautiful just like a wowwCamera quality better than 14
"Box was damaged, phone looks very good, awesome touch feel."
Good phone but battery battery back up is less
Awesome phone but battery is draining faster

My Dream phone I have been use this phone for the last 10 days.Everything is awesome. But Battery backup is really disappointe me.  I hope apple fix it ASAP..
If you playing BGM my mobile India legging problem and also eeting
Battery life was great in the first week and now not so great in the 2nd week. so its not consistent. Haven't felt that 60 hz is slow but 120hz would have been great. Heats up sometimes for no apparent reason which is an issue with the 15 series. easily lasts the whole day and I keep it at charging while I sleep coz it's painfully slow. even with these drawbacks am happy with the switch from android right now. some things are frustrating on ios and very simple on android but you have to adjus...READ MORE
Good phone and I like type c port
Before i use iPhone 13 and jumped to iPhone 15 very good upgrades in 15 only one lacking so everyone is knowing display 60hz is back draw at least 90hz not were to be given
"Good phone. But some times keep thinking why we purchase the same phones rebranded with higher number (iPhone 13, 14, 15 etc.) from Apple every year. Not great updates compared to previous gen phones. Worth purchasing only if you are using very old phone (at least 3 years old) and wait for deals. Been using this one for few months now. No issues and no glitches."
"*Pros:*- Premium design and build quality- Excellent camera performance- Smooth and responsive interface- Impressive display*Cons:*- Battery life could be improvedRating breakdown, according to me, is as follows :-- Performance: 5/5- Camera: 4.8/5- Display: 5/5- Battery: 3.5/5- Overall: 4.5/5"

"To be honest, everything about this phone is a smooth experience until it's about 60Hz refresh rate."
This is my first dream phone and  I am little more fear for online purchasing but when we receive phone they are well maintained and  They working properly and thank you Flipkart
"Only issue I received Jan 2023 productCamera is Awsem, 4 star only due to heating issue"
"First I disappointed due to colour, ordered the blue one and images are also showing some light blue but the original look in hand is white. Is Apple making the is colour blind? Overall satisfied with its well known apple features and battery backup also good. - By ESKG"
60 Hz Display could have been better.
The phone slightly heats. Other than that everything is fine.
"Upgrading my iphone after long years from iphone 7 to iphone 15. This mobile looks really nice to handle. The display quality, performance and camera was working good. The battery backup also improved."
Good for daily use and the mobile performance and camera quality is also excellent but sometimes  iphone can feel heating issues while charging then overall iPhone 15 is an excellent mobile
Value of moneySuper
Suprb
"Everything was best except battery, battery life was very poor"
the phone is god but with heating issue
"Good product, packing this not good."
Feeling crazy
Very good iPhone 15
Its My First iPhone Experience and Loved it :)
Overall good except heating issue
"This is overall a good device. It is a value for money under 65000. Amazing camera, good display, performance. But the only issue it has is over heating while charging."
So far so good.
Grate photo capture
Good phone at the end it is iphone lol
Every thing is just perfect .. but battery should be more
Shifted from Android... ios feels smooth despite having 60hz screen. Device is currently on ios17.4 haven't updated yet as there is issue in next release. No heating or battery issue in this release.
Amazing to good
It is a good product
Good for everything.
Photography and performance is nice
Best for photography/videographyPocket rocketTotally worth it
Best product but sometimes hang.
"Camera is  and performance is amazing but phone will get over heated when we are on FaceTime. Battery will drain so easily, i had to re-charge my phone 3 to 4 times if we are watching 2 movies.Overall i am happy with this phone"
"Phone heats little bit while charging and during heavy tasks , this phone has 60hz refresh rate only and has slightly thick bazzels ."
"Writing after 3 weeks usage of base model.Camera, performance, batter, display are good as we know.People who are switching from android, please bear in mind that lots of small small things aren't available. Basically not user friendly. E.g. Keyboard doesn't have a feature of printing @ symbol on pressing 'a' key long.Another thing regarding camera is you don't have 3rd camera so u won't be able to capture anything from very close distance. If you are into macro photography buy pro or pr...READ MORE"
"Had bought this as a replacement for my iPhone XR. Switching to this brings mixed feelings. In few areas iPhone XR is still superior viz, more ergonomic and more battery efficient.Still I believe it is a good upgrade."
Worthy of purchase
Image quality is good and worth buying it
"Android turned iphone user -  obviously 15 is better than the previous devices by apple in term of camera. Compare to android apple provides limited features but all are robust as the software management is so good.Pros - videos, real time pictures, speed, powerful, more stable videosCons - cant use multiple windows at a time, selling old technology in the name of Dynamic Island, long procedure even to make a call, icon on screen may irritate you if you were android user"
"The phone is nice, but it heats up easily."
The product is good but sometimes feels like a heating issue.
"Just wow .camera,sound,battery good."
Camera is super battery backup nice and performance is great
Decent phone with decent camera. Nowadays you should buy Apple only for its ecosystem. Otherwise go for android.
Battery stand by time 6hrs only and have heat issues some times in normal usage. Otherwisegood product from apple side.
Nothing to say amazing
"The non pro iphone with almost every possible pro feature. The design from back , front is identical to last year pro series with some new update like type C port. Although somethings should have been present in iphone 15 is Higher refresh rate and usb 3.0 . Else everything is good"
mind gloing phone
Product is good... Camara quality is excellent.. better battery expected...
Awesome phone I love it
Awesome phone.. value for money. Performance is very good and easy to handle
Good all specification but need to improve battery
Mobile is heating too much.....
Battery gets hit whenever I charge it.
Betry long time note use gaming
Sound quality is not good of speaker while taking on call
Camera quality is also not that much good and battery performance is zero according to other phone and heating issue is bigger problem ... I pay more than 50k but performce is not good dont buy iphone
Battery drains quickly
Overall the phone is really good but this comes with a very poor battery backup. Really disappointed with the battery backup.
"camera 10/10performance 6/10 (lagging in multitasking+calling/unlock)battery 8/10display 6/10 (if you have used good premium phones avoid this phone, 60Hz not okey)Body 9/10Networks 8/10 (cellular quality issues)"
Phone is very goodBut heating problem is still continuingHeat problem is very very disappointing me
Battrey drain fast
Good camera and battery but ios is still far behind than Android in terms of ease.
Having a great time
Mobile is amazing and super But Front camera lightly disappointed no sharp and beauty and compare to android phone is better possible to software update for camera over all mobile also Good
Mostly  i m using last 10 days an i feel it is very cool and amazing phone battery backup is too good like andoride
the phone is fine but the delivery is very late.
I purchased it only for camera and rola
"This is my dream phone , i am using my 1st iphone . Unfortunately it got an accident, dropped form 2nd floor on road on its screen side, but i am lucky that it got just a dent in one corner, how strong it is. Nothing happened with this phone , i am using it smoothly ."
battery backup poor than androide phone and at chaging phone heat and not charge after 80% until temperture is normal .camera like a 2 MP not better as 15k androide phoneiphone is not user friendly only it for security and status .Dont buy if you face money problem
"I was an Android user, bought this for camera but I am not getting that kind of superior photos that I expected from a phone after spending so much money. Battery time and displayis average."
60hz touch are very bad and slow
Verrrry good product
The camera quality is just amazing. But the battery backup could be better if you are not a heavy user you should go for it.. Absolutely amazing device.
IPhone 15 is an excellent choice .But its battery life disappointed me and also there is a little bit of a heating issue the mobile needs a cooler environment to perform well.The battery doesn't last for a day .For a good battery backup Iphone 15 plus will be a good choice others specs are just the same of boththe devices .Conclusion - If you don't want to struggle for battery go for the plus one .

My first pic with her. This phone is very nice
Upgraded from 13 to 15. Found it worth upgrading. Go for it folks. A big boost is its battery backup and c type port. No need to carry an additional charger with u. Any C type adaptor will do the job.
Awesome quality but phone is little heating
No sumsang galaxy just go for iphone or pixels
Good Product Overall very premium!!!!!
"Other than display, everything is great"

"Grateful to achieve this dream. Once you start with iOS, there is no going back"
"Camera: The 48 MP main camera produces high-quality images, and the automatic portrait mode is a standout feature.Battery life: The iPhone 15 has a long battery life. The iPhone 15 Plus has the best battery life of all the iPhone models in the latest lineup.Design: The iPhone 15 has a satin-finished design and softer edges than previous models, making it more comfortable to hold.

Superb Phone But Issue In Battery Health Only i use 390 recycle of battery but now my battery health is 88%
Superb excellent
i love 15  blue colour awosem
Video quality very goodFor me android is better s24 ultra
"Honestly speaking, long term android users will not get satisfied with iOS, the iPhone is good for social status and shows off, but obviously we always want to have an iphone.If you are looking for a good camera quality then go for s23/s24 (even the base model) , but if you are just looking for a phone with social status then go for this technologcal beauty."
Amazing product I have upgrade from iPhone 12 to iPhone 15 and it is just incredible. Battery performance also improved a lot ..
"Best I phone 15 you should buy ,buy don't buy if your parents can't afford it.don't make them disturb,earn by yourself then buy it"
Super one and the battery consumption is too high. Next generation to make high quality of battery Life
Best mobile under 55 thousand. Camera processing not that good it looks like while taking the picture it shows good but after the photo will be average. Battery will drain fast
"The Phone is awesome but heating issues not resolved by brand. Best all rounder phone under 55k, must buy this phone."
Best Phone thanks for u
Awesome phone... next day delivery
Very Smooth Phone  first time iPhone user.I like Screen Size . one Handed phone  .
Iphone Never disappoints
"I was skeptical in the beginning to order from Flipkart  as the discounts were huge. I checked all the parameters, Serial number, model number, IMEI, quality of box, quality of phone, display. Everything is fine and works properly. Talking about the phone, the performance is amazing. One of the best camera in a phone. Worth it."
Very best camera is the so best I am very happy on this product
I had iphone SE 2 and comparing to iphone 15 it's obviously no match. Without use battery would last for almost 3 days and if I used excessively I would last upto 2 days. Display is good. Camera is unspeakable. Performance is overall good. Its been almost 2weeks I am using it.
Amazing Phone With Great Camera QualityTotally Worth It
superb phone ever best camera 48mp with 2x optical zoom
Nice product but battery issues please solow

Superb iPhoneI jumped 13 to iPhone 15 This phone beats every phone
Camera quality is great but slightly laggy
If you are a iPhone lover and have budget of 70k  ...just go for it
Upgrading from i phone 12 to 15 feels good.cant see the difference in performance coz i am not really into games and cpu intensive tasks.camera is great but the device heats after recording for prolonged time.design is good.the display is good too.
awesome camera
Camera is awesome display and sound quality is amazing
Colour is not satisfactory. Bought blue but seems like white. While charging heating is there hope it will get resolved. Look and compactness is really awesome.After one month use noticed that battery is drawing fast. 16.3.24
The phone is raw in performance
I was looking for a new device to replace my iphone 6s. After waiting long enough found a worthy device to replace my phone. Black is the best colour in the whole base iphone 15 lineup. Happy with my purchase. Thanks Flipkart.
Very nice. Awesome phone
"It is a good phone if you want to limit your usage.. I switched from Android to IOS and have found a lot of limitations in IOS after this switch but for me I never used those customisation and blingy features of Android so I am good with this. Android will give you better camera but video here is better hands down. Smoothness of camera interface is amazing. Other than the fact that this is a 60 Hz display, this is an amazing display. Battery wise, this is a one day phone. It will last you one...READ MORE"
Display is 60 hz and there is some time delay when i open and try to go back. I was using 120 hz display before so it took 1 month to get habitual to use 60 hz panel. Other than that its fine
After using a month-Camera- 8/10Display- 9/10Performance- 7/10Battery- 5/10Looks- 10/10
Need more battery life it only lasts for 4 hrs on my normal usage
I Don't Like Iphone
"I am very happy with this product. It has a great in-hand feel with its matte finish. The camera is excellent, the screen is brighter with Dynamic Island, and it features USB-C and great battery life. While the 60Hz display might be a dealbreaker for some, it is not very noticeable to me. Thank you, Flipkart, for the best deal and quick delivery."
best new phone iPhone 15 well-done
Great phone again. But battery capacity is very low need to be charge twice in a day. 60 Hz display might be a drawback sometimes.Video quality is tremendous. 4 stars for the camera build and performance and -1 for the battery.
Great product. Authentic and original. Got heating issue just after opening the phone but it instantly got resolved when I updated the software.Camera quality doesn't meet the expectations it shakes too much while shooting a video.
Battery  not good and over all experience is good
"Battery is not good need to charger 3 times a day if heavy usage , otherwise need to charge 2 times a day for normal usage"
"Great device, got it at 65348, battery will be ok, not great but ok, camera and performance are good, apple support is great, was an android user before, wanted to try IOS and the overall experience is positive, not that much to leave the android all together but yeah."

This phone is amazing. Camera is outstanding
It's better to buy the Samsung ultra series.. don't waste your money just to create hype.
Pls provide your user minimum 90 fps atleast in non pro model
"Iphone 15 has battery issue and after the ios 18 update the phone battery drain in just 4,5 hours without using it heavily, and i face laging, and heating issue in this in only a week after buying it  waste of money"

Awesome colour
"Don't buy the 128 GB version, go for 256 or higher memory phones. You will regret it if you buy 128 gb version."
"Good display, improved display brightness, awesome camera"
"First Thanks to Flipkart for delivering this at a lightning speed. It was a hassle free purchase and got a good exchange price for my old IPhone. The new IPhone15 is stunning in performance, beautiful pics. and very light weight. Go for it guys,"
"let me be honest here , i have been using iPhones over a decades now .but i personally feels like iphone 15 doesn't have good camera as compared to my pervious iphone SEits just killing the natural skin tone after you take pictures ,,i dont know whats wrong with apple..if you have older iphones and you want to just upgrade for the camera please dont buy it ...go for pro models.."
"Performance is good. At this price apple should give 120 Hz display. Not able to see screen in sunlight, they should use a display which can be more visible in sunlight."
Battery performance needs improvement.

Phone heats up so much while charging or gaming. I am afraid one day it will blast. It's my first iphone experience and I did not in my dreams expect that iphones would heat up like that. Can't even touch it without feeling discomfort and I am not exaggerating. (My previous phone is redmi).
Happy Perfect
Great deal

Camera is not all good. Disappointed. Has issue in wide angle coverage. If you want zoom and cover than photo is shrinked and photo does not seems to be actual photo.
"Switched from Android to iPhone 15 and the experience has been surprisingly smooth. The build quality feels premium, and the display is vibrant and responsive. iOS took a bit to get used to, but it's clean, fast, and intuitive. The camera is a standout and makes the photos look sharp and natural. Battery life is decent, and Face ID is super convenient. I do miss some Android customizations, but overall, the switch feels like an upgrade. Definitely worth switching."

If you do not know where to spend money  and dying to do so then buy iphone. For simple tasks you need to do 3 4 steps which can be done on android 14 in 1 step
Samsung is better then iphone
Only Flipkart will provide in the same price
Everything is great in this phone specially video recording. Screen refresh rate could have been better.
"It's Okay but the galaxy s 24 display is better than iphone 15 but both have phone have If you want ecosystem and compatibility then iPhone is great but if you want latest technology and performance then you can go for Samsung.iPhone optimization is good no doubt Everyone else has their own choice, some take it to show off and Some people buy phones for performance and use them in real like gaming and editing."
Battery is very bad.. it's draining fast.. not even with stand for 6hrs

I have been using this iPhone 15 from 8 months. The battery percentage dropped from 100 to 88% in just 8 months with a daily average screen time of almost 3-4 hours . The battery performance is very very poor.

Best device for ever Ultimate powerful machine
Camera is just AMAZING awesome
Very bad compare samsung mobileOnly camera  is better
The shape is little curved which makes it comfortable to hold. The camera is upgraded and really liked the dynamic island which was missing on my 13
"I was 13 user battry back has improved on 15, camera was ultimate good. Rest almost same dynamic Island is a gimic"
"best you can buy go for it , it got updates till 2030 hence its best u can go !as it depends user to user ! btwbut for long run it's good, other brands do have great phones as well , but after sometime their updates becomes buggy very much ! not the case here ."
Extremely Superb
Worth it
Good !!
"Thanks flipkart for the on time delivery. About the product it's a minor upgrade from 13 and 14... except dynamic island and 48mp camera, of course not to forget 4nm A16 chipset which is a plus"

"Worst experience with flipkart. Mobile didn't even work for 24 hrs. It stopped working and flipkart denied a replacement citing the return policy. I had to submit phone at my nearest apple service centre. Now I might have to wait 10 more days for my phone to come to me.Flipkart should take responsibility in such cases, where the device is clearly at fault. Making us run around the service centre is very bad.Please make sure the right products are getting delivered by sellers before sendi...READ MORE"

"There is nothing wow about this iphone 15. Camera is decent but not the best, battery is very average in that price range, display is good but dynamic island ruins the overall charm, Design is like old school but performance and sound quality is the best.Somebody who is using a 120z display will definitely feel the iphone 15 a little sluggish while scrolling and typing. Overall an average phone with high price tag."
everything is good together
Best Best best
The iPhone is a different matter altogether. The iPhone will never let you down.

Heating issue (while charging and performing a heavy task)Otherwise it is one awesome phone and I found the Dynamic Island really useful and aesthetically pleasing as well. Amazing camera and the oled display is also bright with excellent contrast ratio.

"Well apple is apple at the end of the day so without say cam is good, display is great, touch is super smooth and iOS great!! So if you are thinking to switch from android- this would be a good option! Just one cons tat is heating issue when put on charge and battery doesn;t last as long as that of android phones- so yeah thats a minus point despite charging a price like this. But when it comes to other features- Apple aces it all!"

Not a very noticeable improvement over 13 except the dynamic island bar on the display and a sleeker and lighter feel. Much better hand held experience.Great for a new purchase. Okay for an upgrade.

"No doubt Best in class .if you are looking camera centric phone go for it , you wont regretted only issue that I feel is about battery it could have better."
"I bought the pink color, and it's gorgeous! The phone performs really well with smooth speed and great camera quality. However, with heavy usage, I noticed it tends to get a bit warm. Overall, it's still a fantastic device, but the heating issue is something to keep in mind."
Apple is apple
A great product. Must buy

The issue just is heating other than best choice to go.

Design - 10/10 so good in fand feelingDisplay - 10/10Camera quality - 10/10Refresh rate - 9/10 (60Hz display).... If it's your first iphone then it would feel so good.....Battery - for normal use the battery lasts for 36-40 hrs minimum.... The only problem is the battery drains very fast while using the camera.... If someone uses the camera a lot then the battery lasts for 20-24 hrs....

It looks and performs great. Got it during diwali sale so can say its a value for money device.
Superior build quality. I have faced issue while transferring data from my old iPhone due to iOS 18.1 upgrade. Solved it by installing iOS 18.1 without copying data first and then I transferred data later. The rate offered was best compared to other Ecommerce vendors
Very good product I m verry happy

Apple is authentic in technology
Perfect Quality Phone.

"Doesn't work after 2 days. Even they didn't take any initiative. I received a dead phone. I will suggest to all of you please if u are planning to buy costly phones then buy from the store. I know the store will not provide a huge discount but if you face any issues regarding the phone, they will help you."

Bought it for around 53- 54kI'm telling you it makes more sense to buy an iPhone 15 in 2024  rather than iphone16 which costs you 22k more (for 2 extra buttons and apple intelligence which 'most of you' will barely use on a regular basis )iPhone 15 still gets 5 years of software updates (until 2029)Apple intelligence not yet launched properlySo It requires lots of improves over the time of 2 years atleastSo if you want to experience solid apple intelligence you can exchange your...READ MORE

"I just shifted from android to iOS.The first thing that I noticed is how premium it feels in hand. This black colour looks very good.Camera is awesome, specially the video output is the best out there. Also, among the first things that I noticed was how good the speakers sound and the haptics feel.Some cons:1. Painful to transfer files to and from windows PC.

It is filling annoying."
