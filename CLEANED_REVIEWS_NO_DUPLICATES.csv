I was scared to buy iphone online after hearing horrific stories online. That apple care won't be included and all. But as soon as i started setting up and put the serial number online - got full apple coverage details. Before  creating an apple id the serial number would not show any coverage- so no need to panic just create apple id. Seller to flipkart and seller.,Negative

There are no powerful android phones which are compact to use single handedly..that's the main reason I'm living the iPhone.

"Does iPhone even need a review? Its an amazing product and if you crave for awesomeness, ultra performance, cult and sheer solidarity then go ahead and buy. It has a steep price point but marvellous things do come at a premium. Plan, Save & Then Buy!",Positive
"I upgraded from iPhone 7 Plus, So it a bigger and better screen with smaller form factor ratio. I miss touch id specially in pandemic time but face id solves the purpose most of the time. I bought 128GB variant and the difference from 64GB and 255GB is -10k and +10k which means apple is charging too much for 64GB storage, that means its not value for money exactly.. However buying a 64GB variant is a trap as you will need to keep on deleting data only.",Negative
product is amazing but the experience with flipkart is very bad. I had mentioned GST no of my company at the time of placing the order but there was no gst no mentioned in the invoice. numerous mails and complaints lodged but they refused to provide me GST invoice.,Negative
"Like a beast, all rounder",Positive
"Good build quality, camera & speakers.",Positive
"Undoubtedly awesome in performance, after all it’s , didn’t like battary backup though, with heavy usage can’t survive for a day, need to juice up in evening, another disadvantage is No fast charging.. Camera is good but not best out there and also keep in mind there is no file manager for data management and data sharing is not as easy as android.",Negative
Truly said 'its just not a phone.. it's an IPhone ... Very very nice. . super satisfiedIt's just apple should have given basic things like charger within the box,Positive
"Perfect iPhone . Glad that I Pick iPhone 12 instead of iPhone 11 , Prices are bit high but Features are completely fill that Price Gap . I love that Device . Happy User",Positive
Best product you can trust Flipkart. delivered in two days,Positive
Just bought my first iPhone. Been using it for like 15 days now. This is littt.Was worried about battery performance before buying. But it far exceeded the expectations. Can last even 2 days if you use judiciously with low power mode.20W adaptor is sufficient.A decent power packed smartphone tailored to fit in all needs.,Positive
No doubt Look and Feel is premium which gives you different feeling when you put out it from your pocketCamera + Display + Battery which is very less in numbers but actual performance is far better than 108MP camera + 7inch Display + 7000mah batteryPricing as usual is very high even if it is purchased in sale moreover they don’t even provide charger earphones back cover tempered glass even booklet is of single page,Positive
I was using realme x7 max before purchasing iPhone 12 but honestly I want to tell one thing that iPhones are overhyped and nothingI don’t feel any upgradation from my previous phone but compromised from many aspects.So please don’t waste your money for a false status and choose an good android phone and invest your rest money for your better future.,Positive
"Reviewing this after 3 months of use...You can't find anything wrong with this new iPhone 12 , finest camera quality , sound quality, luxury feeling this is little atom bomb , got the best deal by Flipkart",Positive

"Was using the OnePlus 7 pro before this, it was a 2 year old device but still had better battery backup than this Iphone. Rest you all know its an iphone, great camera, nice screen, ios is very smooth and consistent which many android phones lack, Face ID is a pain during Covid and boy they don't give charger which sucks.Overall a nice phone, battery should have been better",Positive

"I bought this phone on August 2024. It is an excellent product. Top quality and top performance. Works perfectly well in 2024. No much difference with the 13, 14 or 15, unless you want to have more features in your camera. Otherwise the regular user will never mention any difference in speed and performance between compared with A14 and A15 unless you play very heavy games. I am happy with the product and I also wish to thank Flipkart for prompt delivery.",Positive
"My first iPhone, the best experience,out of 64 gb around 50 gb we get to use which is enough for me.",Positive
Battery last for less than a day when used much but very ultra fast chargingOverall nice product.  Donot break screen easily as like other mobiles. Strong.  I like in this concern.,Positive

"Thank God my oppo reno 8 pro couldn't be delivered and I had to order Iphone 12. IOS is buttery smooth, camera is excellent, video stabilization is too good, 100% lag free performance, battery last for 1 day with moderate to bit heavy usage but it doesn't fit for gaming, I would recommend to go for iphone 14 if budget is tight so wait for upcoming sales. This is my first flagship and first iphone and I am very impressed with everything that flagship android can't provide at this price point. ...READ MORE",Positive

"Great camera, great displayOnly battery backup is less and heating issues.",Positive
I have bought iPhone as i have been gifted with airpods and now apple watch. So taking about the pros are it has superb screen and camera is way to awesome. I feel UI is better than andriod phone and Siri helps a lot. Cons would be battery backup is not good as compared to andriod phones. Also I bought it for 67999 which is indeed a good amount. Also it only has one sim so you cant use two sim like android. So its upto you to decide which suits you more and buy accordingly.,Positive
Battery is typically like a 4000mah device uses with two sims. ( assuming u use iphone 12 with one sim with location wifi etc off). For office type use its no issue. Field work types people will want more battery for sure. Cameras are good. Apps aren’t bulletproof as they claim. Ola app has bugs. Doesn’t hang. But its still not as fast fluid as one plus. Its not slow mind it. But the buttery transitions on ios make it relatively slow. Speakers have bass sorta.,Positive
Decent Device at decent price.!Disclaimer: I’ve received this for Rs. 49400/-Performance: Up to the mark.Display : ABattery: You have to charge everyday if you are a moderate user . Also it has a great standby time as compared to its android competitors.Camera: It takes good photos but I do miss Gcam.Android or IOS: well android gives lot of freedom to customise your device and download apps that are restricted in play store and this is not the case in IOS .Though Apps  run better on IO...READ MORE,Positive

Providing review after 1 month of use .. no doubt it’s a good mobile handling is very smooth n performance is very good as well front camera is descent back camera is awesome with a nice detailing… cons battery life is not very long proper use of phone may need charging once in every 10 hours … if you lay down and try to open the phone by face recognition then it doesn’t work .. you need to hold the phone flat parallel to your bed then it opens up.,Positive
I loved it! Also loved the color! I hoped a better camera though…,Positive

My first IPhone after using Android phones for around 12 years. Really don’t regret switching. Like how everything just works. So refined. Camera too is very consistent.

Awesome Display. Nice Camera. Smooth Performance,Positive
"Overall a good phone but camera is not as it was hyped. May be software update can change the camera quality. Specifically, the portrait edge detection is not at all good. Other than that the build and finish is excellent. Display is very good. The phone is responsive. Overall a very good phone but not a phone to be priced above 60 - 65K for 128 GB.",Positive

This is the best iphone to buy compared to 12 pro.Black colour is way better than blueScreen is quad hd and not full hd which is found in samsung s21 plus at the same price range.Rest functioning is buttery smoothFace id works like charmDon’t worry of smudges as they are not that prominent if u are looking at phone directly but in 12 category i think you should go for only this colour option besides white.Matt sides are good  for handling and there are no smudge problem there.,Positive

BUT, the game crashed a couple of times recently in my iPhone 12 and before crashing it got stuck also which is a matter of concern & raises the eye in suspicion.

"Battery drains real quick.. if you are using mobile data,this is not the mobile for you.. it uses so much of data due to the quality of videos and everything… but mobile is fast and camera is perfect.. looks premium very comfortable to use..",Positive
"The phone is terrific... but the charging  cable was not working which came along with the i phone 12,  i had to go out to purchase another one in a near by store",Positive
Best for money investment ,Positive
Best ever iPhone experience with iPhone 12. Go for it.,Positive
"Seriously I didn’t the camera quality better, I was using 6 and now moved to 12 but 6 camera quality is good in terms of worth of the product however overall product is really nice",Positive
Feeling blessed even after paid full amount for the product.Amazing Mobile. Encashed more than paid.Thaks Flipkart for timely delivery .,Positive
It’s an amazing photo. Looks nice feels nice and great to use. Extremely lightweight for hand and pocket. Perfect size for one hand usage.,Positive
"Camera is great, specially night shots.I am getting more than a day of battery back up with my usage. I don’t play games.Performance is top notch.Being in Apple ecosystem from 10 years it’s a habit you can change anymore.",Positive
It's just ok.. camera is not as good as people sayIt's not worth spending huge amount. Build quality is good.. looks ok.. screen is good.. battery worst..charging speed poorUsability ok ok..,Positive
"The phone’s battery is not at all comparable to One Plus. Comparing with 9R. The charging is very slow even with genuine 20w apple charger. And battery drainage is much higher.FYI, I am a normal user and neither I have not yet installed any game, nor I am a heavy video viewer or something. So, even normal usage won’t give more than 20 hours anyhow… Apple is betraying customer in this aspect!Rest other aspects are 5*",Negative
Product is very nice….Really fantastic feeling when we use iPhone…Camera Quality is awesome…everyone wants my phone to capture his/her pictures…I never observed this things when im using before any other company phones….but screen is small i feels… u can prefer i phone 12 pro max for larger display but price is too high…Previous im using i phone 6 plus which has larger display….Very much thanks for Flipkart who gave original i phone 12 and prompt delivery…Appreciated…,Positive

Bought ahead of iPhone 13. Saved 10k Feeling so happy with the butter smooth performances,Positive
"Ok here’s the thing. The only thing apart from the charger that will probably make you think twice ‘why apple, you could have at least added this’ is the Apple earphones. At least a wired one. That’s not much of an impact but at one moment it will for sure hit you. Otherwise it’s an amazing phone. The best so far.",Positive

Switching to iOS after Android was a bit weird for me at first but it was such an amazing experience for me. The display looks so crisp and wonderful and the phone never fails to amaze me. The battery life is something that could be better but it is still good enough for hours of gaming or bingeing. I am really glad I chose iPhone 13 as my first iPhone ever :),Positive

What an Iphone. The best Apple could do till date. It has probably everything which a smart phone user needs and more. I have moved to Apple from Android and I AM LOVING IT. The smoothness even at 60hz is unmatched with Android's 120hz speed. The peace of mind with Apple security is brilliant. The only thing is about investing in chargers and cables and cases when you move from Android. But these are built to last for atleast 4 years and maximum 5 years.

The caller speaker (L) acts as a 2nd speaker so thats why sound quality weakens on default.

If you are a light phone users who actually use your phone for camera and phone calls it's a best option for you but if you are into gaming a lot this might not be the right choice for you honestly because it gets warm so if you want realistic picture and natural looking videos on a budget it's best and you can definitely go for it and the performance is also pretty good on this price,Positive

"Coming from an iPhone 11, the upgrade is not completely unnecessary. I can see few daily improvements which impacts me personally. The battery back up is a good upgrade. The cameras are obviously better. The Dynamic Island is alright but not something I cannot live without. Face ID works smoother.I am not into games, so no comments on that. For a regular person, this phone is more than enough. And for people with other Apple devices, this is just an awesome part of the ecosystem.",Positive

If you can match the trend set in ios you may go for it but if you don't stick with your android. People m...READ MORE",Positive
"I am very happy to buy it because its camera is very good and its performance is also very good, its features are also very good and will never make you bored.",Positive

Worth every penny .. Confused between pixel and iPhone but no regrets to buy an iPhone,Positive
"Bought it from flipkart, as I was getting the best price here!",Positive
"The best in class iphone. Many people may mock iPhone, but everyone have to accept that iPhone has the best in class features and technology. It is obviously not fair to compare iPhone and android because each have its own pros and cons. Seeing the features that iPhone provide at this price point is really of premium level and I am pretty sure you are gonna enjoy using this awesome device.Speaking about specs, iPhone 15 has the best camera till date, the best display, awesome battery managem...READ MORE",Positive
"I appreciate that the iPhone 15 has turned its weakest aspect, the dynamic range, into one of its strongest features. However, the 60 Hz display bothers me daily. It's not that a 60 Hz display is inherently bad, but after spending so much on a phone in 2024, not getting a smooth display experience is disappointing. This makes it the most expensive phone with a 60 Hz display. Apart from that, everything else is superb.",Positive
Camera quality is superb and battery backup also.,Positive
"Awesome phone, thanks to Flipkart for quick delivery. This is my 1st iOS experience so very excited .",Positive
The person to whom it's gifted says that everything is  great. Hope it was a little cheaper and more affordable.,Positive

Camera is a major upgrade over previous models. If you have 12 or older you can upgrade to 15 without thinking,Neutral
"Back to iPhone family from android, best upgrade phone. Fully satisfied with the design and the performance. Minimum 10hrs of battery on single charge (12hrs in low power mode). No lags and even it charges very fast up to 80% which is decent.",Positive

"BEST camera and performance,",Positive
Absolutely Amazing!Premium matte body!,Neutral
Just wowBuy it now,Neutral
Best phone nice camera and performance,Positive
"Very BAD experience I'm extremely disappointed with my iOS experience after switching from Android. While the camera and display are outstanding, performance issues overshadowed these positives. Within two days, I encountered severe battery drain (only 4-5 hours) and overheating. Worse, the phone lags and becomes unbearably hot. These issues mar an otherwise great device.",Negative
Battery Health Dropped to 85% in 6 months. Rest everything is ok.,Neutral
"While iPhones are superior to other brands, the battery life can be disappointing for heavy user, and the display size isn't the best for gaming.Nevertheless, they're worth buying.",Negative
Apple should give charger with every device,Neutral
Superb in performance but the battery backup is soo poor at 70k,Negative
Everything is good but battery drops in a half day it means you need to charge 2 times in a day. Battery drops very fast. Apple should improve battery performance.,Positive
All is good but hit too much so don't ignore,Positive
"The phone is pretty good in terms of camera.  However, those who have used 120hz premium display phones will find the display experience to be bad.",Positive
Iphones are always bestDual sim feature should also come,Neutral

Picture quality was awesome.,Positive
The only hitting issue is there. If that will resolve then this phone will be the masterpiece.,Positive

Awesome pics by iphone 15. Love it,Positive
Much faster and best camera only issue of battery one day easily use after full charge. Design Awesome .best color in images and 4K with 60 fps is awesome.,Positive
Apple as usual. Eco system is great. Rest all are average for the price but I paid for the ecosystem,Positive
Heating issue but overall good phone,Positive
"Actually phone is very good this is my first iPhone i found heating at back panel at normal usage also, it should be fixed asap because giving 80k for premium feel and still not feels worthy after heating, it gains heat very fast and cools down too but due to heat battery drop is very fast .",Neutral
Nice product but the heating issue n battery can be improved,Positive
Photo Quality is Excellent But Battery performance and Heat issue,Positive
"A great phone with quality display 60Hz, average to good battery backup, speaker same as 14, camera is very good in this segment, performance toooo good for this compact sized phone almost never heated much except for charging and bgmi though normal for every phone. Dynamic island animations are great though not a fan of it still better than notch. And design is amazing very premium.",Positive

A great upgrade from iPhone 11..The battery backup is great it is even better than iPhone 15pro which is obvious due to the proMotion 120hz display..Yes you'll feel the absence of 120hz but it doesn't matters that much until you play games yes you won't get 90fps on bgmi but yes still you can play games without any hesitation everyone mostly knows that and yes 60fps is enough coz our eyes can fully utilise the 60fps Higher fps are just eye pleasing..So It is not a big deal..Camera performance...READ MORE,Positive

"Nothing to say..(Camera, performance, display, design, battey service )Everything is Perfect",Positive
"As always, Apple doing its job perfectly! Superb Phone!",Positive
"Overall: The iPhone 15 is a fantastic phone for everyday use, it offers a compelling blend of performance, camera prowess (no doubt the best camera), and battery life (as per my use it is easily lasting 1 full day). However, the lack of a high refresh rate display and the underwhelming charging speed hold it back from being truly exceptional.Pros:Superb Cameras: The 48MP main sensor captures stunning photos with excellent detail and dynamic range. Low-light performance is also impressive. ...READ MORE",Positive

The divice is very heating problem,Negative
"Guys dont listen to negative reviews about 60hz display and batter heating issues. ios makes you forget that you are using a 60hz display cuz its much better than a 90hz or 120hz display in android. zero bugs, amazing user interface, best camera in class. after using oneplus, samsung, redmi, realme, infinix and oppo for the past 10 years, finally am realising why people hype iphones. truly amazing experience.",Positive
Just Awesome - Was bit skeptical about 60Hz but it feels extremely smooth.- No heating issues at all.- Camera quality is also good.- Overall nice upgrade for me after using poco f1 for half a decade.I would definitely recommend it. Just go for it you wont regret.,Positive
"It ticks all the basic boxes well as expected. But had a lot of expectations from the camera as it was one of the primary reasons for buying iPhone. I can tell you - just go with a Samsung if you want to click photos without thinking too much.The iPhone's camera is not good for Indian human subjects with darker skin tones. It over-processes the image way too much and makes you look much darker than you are. Not just human subjects, it overprocesses everything. The final image looks very dif...READ MORE",Negative
Very Best baseline iPhone ever. even if you have a iphone 14 it is still a upgrade. the new frosted glass and rounded edges make it premium feel. camera is just awesome. better than 14 pro camera. battery is just like iphone 14. type c is also a welcome with braided data cabel. just blue colour looks a lot like white.,Positive

Android is better than ios,Positive
"High quality cameraThe iPhone 15 has a new 48-megapixel main camera. The new camera sensor is larger than the one in the iPhone 14, and it has better low-light performance. The iPhone 15 also has a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera and a new 12-megapixel telephoto camera.",Positive
Not justifying the price .. bit disappointed about the  display (refresh rate should be high).. no differences between 12 and 15 except brightness .. those who willing to upgrade plz be ok with your 13 .. there is very low difference in day to day life use..but the Dynamic Island is awesome it is way better than expected..,Positive
"AFTER ONE WEEK OVERALL PERFOMANCE IS GOOD BUT  FEW APPLE MUST IMPROVE 1. Design very Round on Corner gives a feel of baby Toy, 2. Some thing must improve in iOS 17 its very Classic in this mordern era like Auto Rotate not possible on photos you will have to go home select rotate lock etc.",Positive

"Amazing phone overall, camera is good even in low light, telephoto camera is quite unique to get more closer photos without loosing quality, display as always amazing, but bas model 60 hz gotta comprise with that and last not least around 7 8 hrs with medium usage battery life.",Positive

Pros of iPhone 15:1. Best camera in the segment (improved photo and video quality).2. Powerful performance.3. Dynamic island gives it a better look than the previous iphone 14.4. Comes up with Type-C port (but only 2.0).Cons of iPhone 15:1. Battery could have been better.2. Slow charging speed.3. 2.0 Type C gives slow transfer speeds when compared to 3.14. Apple is still stuck with 60hz display when others are offering 120hz in a very less price tag!,Positive

If you are someone who wants to start content creating, you can go for this phone for sure. Battery performance is good too, it gives upto 1day battery backup on normal usage. If you play games on it like Bgmi, Codm etc, it would give a backup of 4hrs. I think it is sufficient for someone who likes mobile gaming.",Positive
